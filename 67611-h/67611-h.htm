<div><h1>FOREWORD</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A visit to any modern French Art Gallery will reveal a
number of canvases daubed all over with little patches
of primary colours, almost as though the picture had been
painted with confetti. Assuming you are unaccustomed to
this form of application, you will declare against it with
insular promptitude. But give the picture a chance—step
back and view it from the far wall, and like as not you
will find that these chaotic colours have blended and commingled,
have ceased to exist as individual items and
become merged in a single statement of meaning the artist
intended to convey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not always want of a single material that persuades
the fashioning of a patchwork quilt. Patchwork, in its
way, is as complete as are the green plush curtains that
hang so soberly from the lacquered pole in your neighbour’s
parlour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a motive in this preamble; I did not leap from
a canvas to a patchwork quilt without purpose. When
you have read these pages, if so be you have the patience
and inclination, you will perceive what that motive is.
Let me then forestall the inevitable criticism, “Why, this
is but a series of events strung together by a mere thread
of personality,” and say at once, “Agreed; but that was
the intention.” And I would ask you to hold out the
book at arm’s length, get a fair perspective, and admit that
it was not possible to deal with the subject otherwise, and
that these disjointed clippings tumble together in a kind
of united whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The life of a touring actor is as no other man’s. It is
a series of ever-changing pictures connected only by the
Sunday train-journey. The most we can do is to catch
a glimpse here and there as he halts upon the Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, then, are a few such glimpses for your approval
or contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay stepped from his first-class
compartment to the platform. Potter, his dresser,
having descended from the train while it was still in motion,
respectfully held open the carriage door lest his august
master should soil his beautiful wash-leather gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gratifying to observe how the station porters
touched their caps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the seat of the compartment he had vacated lay an
open suit-case, several brown-paper-covered plays, copies
of the <span class='it'>Era</span> and the <span class='it'>Referee</span>, an umbrella and a travelling
cap. It was part of the dresser’s duties to clear up the
débris occasioned by Mr. Cardomay. A man who carries
in his head all the emotions and all the lines—<span class='it'>Hamlet</span>, <span class='it'>Richard
III.</span>, <span class='it'>The Silver King</span>, and countless other rôles of
lesser importance—could hardly be expected to give attention
to such a trifling matter as his own personal property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet accepted a bundle of letters from an obsequious
advance agent, returned, with condescension, the tentative
salutes of several members of his company, and
passed down the long grey platform with springing step.
The yellow smoke of the Midlands was as violets to his
nostrils and as balm to his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With quiet satisfaction he noted how the ticket-collector
at the barrier, instead of demanding his ticket, allowed
him to pass with a polite “Good morning, Sir.” After all,
it is something to be known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cardomay invariably walked to his lodging, thereby
giving a large section of his future public the opportunity
of studying his features at close range, unadorned by the
artifices of the make-up box or the beneficent influences
of limelight. This walk also gave him a chance of seeing
whether the effect of his billing justified the cost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For twenty-five years had Eliphalet Cardomay “featured
on the road,” and there was little left for him to learn
about Provincial Theatrical Management.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poster which preceded him to town displayed a
well-proportioned man, whose head tilted fearlessly upon
broad shoulders, and whose eyes shone as with a smouldering
fire. A full growth of hair projected from under the curving
brim of a Trilby hat. He wore a flowing tie, a fur-collared
coat, and in his right hand carried an ivory-topped
Malacca cane of original design. It was a striking poster,
executed many years before, and everyone who knew it,
and knew Eliphalet, marvelled how the original still continued
to realise the picture in every detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader will have judged, and judged rightly, that
our hero is one of the Old School—the school of graceful
calisthenics, and meticulous elocution—but let him beware
of anticipating too far; for, although Eliphalet Cardomay’s
histrionics might savour of the obsolete, he will not find
in the man himself those traits usually allied to actors of
this calibre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all his long career no one had ever heard Eliphalet
address a fellow-performer as “laddie,” nor a theatrical landlady
as “Ma.” Neither did he borrow half-crowns at the
Bodega, nor absorb tankards of Guinness’s stout in the
wings. In fact, Eliphalet Cardomay was a very estimable
fellow, hedged about and wing-clipped by stale conventions
of his calling, which, in spite of his bitterly-learnt knowledge
of their existence, he was never able to supersede by
modern methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The almost impertinent disregard for old stage processes
and old accepted technique which brings notoriety and
admiration to the actor of to-day was as unattainable to
Eliphalet as the peak of Mount Parnassus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty-five years before, a London newspaper had prophesied
that he would mature and become big. He did
mature, but on the lines of his beginning, and when at last
he returned to London—the Mecca of his dreams—he was
driven by laughter back to the provinces whence he had
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hearts of provincial playgoers there were still
warm places for Eliphalet Cardomay, and the rich cadences
of his voice never failed to arouse strange emotions and
irrepressible yearnings in the bosoms of impressionable
young ladies, who wrote and confided their admiration with
surpassing regularity and singular lack of reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his own company he was always courteous and considerate,
but a trifle remote. He wrapped himself about
in mystery, and as no one knew exactly how to take him
very few made the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The public man should always be an enigma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He addressed this statement to a very voluble young
member of his company, who frequented bars and lavished
cigarettes upon total strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be mysterious if you wish to succeed,” he continued,
developing the theme. “Your never-ceasing ‘Have a spot,’
and your ever-open cigarette-case, are the most obvious
things that ever happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally Eliphalet Cardomay was looked upon as something
of a joke. A man with a name like that could hardly
expect anything else. Yet to him the name Eliphalet, which
his sire, a once-distinguished tragedian, had borne before
him, was one of his most cherished possessions. Like a
blare of trumpets it rang out from a hundred hoardings.
It was electric—original—arresting. A title to juggle with;
and yet, so strange is the human mind, so averse to aught
but the copper coinage of the language, that his few intimate
friends and the inner circles of all provincial Green
Rooms knew, spoke and thought of him by no other appellation
than “The Old Card.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let it be clearly understood that no one called him the
Old Card to his face; for, although regarded as a joke,
Eliphalet was clearly loved by his fellows, and if at times
they indulged in the gentlest of leg-pulling there was not
one amongst them who would willingly have caused him
the slightest pain or distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to our hero, striding briskly over the cobble
streets on the particular Sunday morning on which our
narrative opens. Every feature of the ugly midland town
was familiar to him and every feature good. Taking a
turning to the right, he pursued his way through a narrow
and deserted alley between two factories. There was an
acute angle a little further down, and here on a wall facing
him a full-length prototype of himself had been posted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet stopped and saluted his printed image.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old boy,” he said, “we are back—back home again.
I deserted you for a while—a little while—but I’ve learnt
my lesson, old friend, and we will see the rest of the show
out together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tremor in his voice as he spoke the words
and an unnatural mist before his eyes. It was this same
mist, perhaps, that delayed his noticing that the billsticker
had applied the last sheet of the poster at least ten inches
too high, with the result that the feet were practically
attached to the knees. Mr. Cardomay made a note of the
fact in a small book he carried for the purpose and continued
his walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two factory girls nudged each other as he passed them
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See who it was? Mister What-you-call Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I like ’im. ’E’s good! When’ll we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of their remarks drifted out of earshot, but
Eliphalet Cardomay felt a tinge of pride warming his
bosom. He was back again—back home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excellent Mrs. Booker, best of landladies, greeted
him with every indication of respectful devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a treat to see you again, sir, it is indeed,” she said,
opening the door of the comfortable little parlour, where
a jolly fire was burning in the grate and reflecting its rays
on many framed and autographed photographs of the celebrated
artists the room at one time or another had accommodated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I heard you’d gorn to London, I said to Booker,
‘There! we’ve lorst ’im,’ and ’e says, ‘I believe we ’ave,’
and I says, ‘That’s what we ’ave done; for, depend on it,
if London gets hold of ’im, it’ll claim ’im as their own and
never let ’im go.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet’s lips tightened a little. He drew off his gloves
and cast them on the embossed green plush sofa, and
quoted:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The clinging magic runs,</p>
<p class='line0'>They will return as strangers,</p>
<p class='line0'>They will remain as sons.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“I returned as a son—and could not remain as a
stranger.” Then, observing that his remarks were entirely
lost upon his audience, he concluded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you get me a small leg of lamb, Mrs. Booker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A beautiful leg,” she replied; “with a black-currant tart
to follow. I ’aven’t forgotten your little likes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet smiled beatifically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an excellent good woman,” he said. Then,
stretching himself luxuriously, “Yes, there is no doubt
at all—it is very good to be back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cast a loving and possessive eye over the homely surroundings,
shook out his table napkin, and drew up a chair
to the table, as a king might sit at a banquet.</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>Probably the reader is wondering what this story is all
about, and certainly it might have been a distinct advantage
to have begun at the beginning rather than the end. Having
committed ourselves so far, however, there is no option
but to retrace our steps to a period some three months
prior to the foregoing incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the conclusion of a long tour that Eliphalet
Cardomay received a startling proposal from London that
he should appear in the title-part in Oscar Raven’s dramatisation
of the Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For weeks past the production had been boomed in all
the dramatic columns, and the advertised cast practically
made a corner in the biggest stage stars of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Owen Frazer, Actor-Manager and Knight (with danger
of becoming a baronet), was to have appeared as Cellini,
and had favoured several reporters with extensive interviews
in which he sought to convey to the public mind
the depths of his research into Cellini’s character. He had
even gone to the length of growing a real beard for the
part, rather than relying on the good offices of Mr. Clarkson.
Therefore, when at the eleventh hour his voice entirely
forsook him, and Harley Street unanimously declared that
it would forsake him altogether unless he gave it a rest
for a month, consternation in dramatic circles ran very
high indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eight days existed before the much-advertised first night,
and the finding of a fitting successor was at once the most
baffling and the most urgent affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an all-night sitting, in which the name of every
prominent male member of the profession was suggested,
and in which Mr. Oscar Raven and his part collaborator,
Julian Franks, nearly came to blows with every member
of the Syndicate, each other included, the producer, a
young man whose youth was only exceeded by his brilliance,
rose and standing, flamingo-like, on one leg, addressed
the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, get to bed,” he said. “You are talking
bilge, the whole lot of you. I’ll find someone—in fact,
I have already. You will say I am mad,” he continued,
in response to a chorus of inquiries which greeted his statement,
“but even at so great a risk I will tell you his name.
It is Eliphalet Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond Wakefield was quite right when saying they
would accuse him of madness. Sir Owen Frazer wrote
on a piece of paper the opinion that he was probably dangerous
as well. But Wakefield only laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Commend me to authors for stupidity and to syndicates
for lack of intelligence,” he observed. “It is evident none
of you have the smallest acquaintance with the character
of Cellini or the art of Eliphalet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the man can’t act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Raven!” expostulated Wakefield. “The man
never ceases to act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not the kind we want,” from Franks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be my duty to stop him acting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has no brains,” contributed Sir Owen, more by gesture
than sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, on the other hand, have plenty,” the producer modestly
remarked. “Just consider the character of Cellini, and
what do we find? Conceit, bombast. Probably he had a
beautiful voice, certainly a chivalrous manner, unquestionably
an incapacity to realise his own ineffability. Turn to
Eliphalet and you find the exact prototype. <span class='it'>Compris?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, yes!” said Julian Franks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Oscar Raven stretched out a silencing hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does this man Cardomay strike you as the kind of
personality that could ever have achieved the masterpieces
which came from the hand of Cellini?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course, that is pure rot,” returned Wakefield.
“That was where Frazer was all over the place in the part.
Trying to convey an undercurrent of massive brain-power.
Believe me, the work of great artists is entirely spontaneous—they
carry no stamp of genius. Look at Raven, for
instance! He has written quite a remarkably good play.
Does his exterior suggest it? No. Anyone’d mistake him
for a haberdasher’s assistant. But I’m off to bed. Fix it
up amongst yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was how Eliphalet Cardomay was dragged from
the provinces and hurled into the forefront of the London
stage, with a great part and eight days in which to
study it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the train bore him towards the Metropolis, he repeated
over and over to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has come at last. They want me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind flew back to the old press-cutting of twenty-five
years ago. “One day this young man will mature and
become big.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll show ’em, old boy!” he said. Yet behind it all
was a strange fear—a queer, nervous doubt—the same
doubt which had ever stood between him and his cherished
dreams of appearing in the West End with a production
of his own. He had never taken the plunge—he had never
swum across the Thames from the Surrey side, and it is
probable he never would have done. But now the great
ones had stretched out their hands and said, “Come over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>London is a chilling place to the stranger, and Eliphalet
felt the chill almost before his foot touched the platform.
There was no genial cap-touching from the porters—no
polite salutation from the official at the ticket-barrier. He
took a cab. There was no particular point in walking—he
could scarcely expect to be recognised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fur-coated and Trilby-hatted, Eliphalet Cardomay entered
the stage-door of the Duke of Connaught’s and
mixed with the company. It was curious what little notice
was taken of him. He might have been nobody. Presently
a business-manager came and asked if he were Mr.
Cardomay, and, learning this was the case, carried him
off to an office near the roof to sign contracts and discuss
details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall require my own poster to be used,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The business manager shook his head. “Sorry,” was all
he said. Then added, “Reiter is doing the posters, you see.”
It was said so conclusively that argument was out of the
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet fell back on his second line of defences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take it that my name will come first on the bills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Characters in order of their appearance is the
way we are working it. Shall we get back to the stage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was led down through countless corridors until they
arrived at their destination. Here Oscar Raven came forward
and introduced him to several of his fellow-players.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get at it,” came a voice from the stalls. “How
de do, Mr. Cardomay. You’ve read the part, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not only read the part,” he replied, “I have
studied the first act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to hear that,” Wakefield cheerfully replied.
“You may have got hold of the wrong end of the stick.
Here, wait a bit. I’ll come up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet turned in surprise to the author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that very young man?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raymond Wakefield—our producer,” replied Raven,
as one who spoke of the gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Wakefield appeared through the iron door
and skated on to the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant to read it to you first,” he said, without any
preamble. “But never mind. Now, what’s your idea of the
part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cardomay had never been cross-examined before,
and didn’t like it; but he replied, politely enough:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a very good part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes; but I mean, how are you taking it? Comedy,
tragedy, farce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can scarcely exist two opinions, Mr. Wakefield,
Cellini is a great thinker—a poet—a philosopher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, no! Light comedy is what we want; light comedy
to the verge of farce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Wakefield, I do not appreciate jokes in regard to
my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Raven intervened with, “You are so extreme, my
dear Raymond. After all, Cellini was a great artist, and
in my conception——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Raven,” said Wakefield, running his fingers
through his pinky-yellow hair, “you’ll have to stop
away from rehearsals if you can’t shake those absurd ideas
from your brain. The Cellini I want, and mean to have,
is the man who had <span class='it'>liaisons</span> with his models, committed
murders, and yet was an artist <span class='it'>malgré lui</span>. You see what
I mean?” He fired the query at Eliphalet. “You’ve read
the biography, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have little leisure for reading,” replied the actor, feeling
a trifle dazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must do so at once, then. Come on, and I’ll go
over some passages with you now at the Savage. Reynolds,
take the crowd scenes—we’ll be back by two.” And
he gripped Eliphalet to whisk him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet Cardomay would not allow himself to be
hustled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Wakefield,” he said, “I have eight days in which
to study a long and important role. I do not choose to
squander any of these precious hours in profitless discussion.
Let us proceed to rehearse at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was mutiny—rank mutiny. It is doubtful whether
the great Sir Owen Frazer, at present seated at the back of
the stalls, would have presumed to say as much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond Wakefield’s cherubic face went into a series of
straight lines. He had never before been openly defied
and his sense of humour deserted him. It deserted him
for eight consecutive days, during which time he gave Eliphalet
Cardomay every kind of hell. Unmindful of the
very characteristics which had prompted him to make the
engagement, he caught up every stereotyped inflexion, each
elaborate gesture, and subjected it to the most rigorous
criticism, analysis and correction. In justice it should be
admitted that, according to modern standards, there was
a very sound reason for all his suggestions. Raymond
Wakefield was never at a loss for reasons. He kept up a
running fire of interrogation as to what Eliphalet was driving
at, and Eliphalet never could answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why chant that passage as though it were a hymn,
when the whole intention of the line is—Ouch! You speak
the stuff like the ancients spoke blank verse. There! When
you are telling Pietro to bring you ‘raw gold’—you say
‘raw gold’ as though it were something sacred and divine.
My dear fellow, it’s the stuff you’re working in every day of
the week. Try and imagine yourself a plumber saying to
his mate, ‘Get us a lump of putty, Jack.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Eliphalet resented this treatment hotly, but he
was no match for this electric young man. On the third
day of rehearsals he had been so ill-advised as to retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget that I was acting many years before you
were thought of.” He regretted the words almost before
he had spoken them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he sat down on his bed and reviewed the
whole affair. His belief in himself was shattered. He
realised that all the painful years of acquired technique
were valueless. His entire stock-in-trade had been exploded
and held up to ridicule by a young man who could
scarcely need to shave more than twice a week. And the
worst of it was that his resentment for that young man had
died, and in his heart he confessed that all and everything
he had been told was good and true and right, and
that his own methods were bad and false and wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning he did a very gracious act. He apologised
to Raymond Wakefield and promised to do his best in the
future. Unhappily, the apology came at an inopportune
moment. Both authors had been reviling Wakefield for letting
them down, and had declared that the play would be
ruined as a result of his casting. They insisted that Cardomay
must be got rid of and the production postponed.
Wakefield never admitted himself at fault, and a stormy
scene resulted. Eventually Sir Owen Frazer was appealed
to, and, to the general astonishment, he wrote on a sheet
of paper, his voice being inoperative, that if either or both
of the suggestions were carried out he would institute proceedings
against everyone concerned. Being lessee of the
theatre, nothing more could be said at the time, but subsequently
Messrs. Raven and Franks foregathered and
spoke hard words anent Sir Owen—who, they declared,
being unable to play the part himself, desired nothing better
than to see it mutilated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can understand, therefore, why Eliphalet’s apology
was not so well received as it deserved. In fact, all that
Raymond Wakefield said was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to hear it, for we’ve any amount of lost ground to
make up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours and days that followed were pitiful to the
point of tragedy. The Old Card worked like a dray horse
at the new art of being natural, which, despite his utmost
effort, further and further eluded him. At the last dress-rehearsal
there was not a line nor a movement, from start
to finish, which fitted him anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both authors left the theatre in a state of speechless fury
at the end of the second act, and when the curtain fell on
the final scene of the play, Raymond Wakefield just looked
at him, shook his head, and followed their example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay, a perfect picture in his Florentine
robes, stood like a statue in the middle of the deserted
stage. An overmastering desire possessed him to hide his
head and cry like a child in some dark recess. He moved
unsteadily toward the prompt corner. The iron door beside
it was open, and there, in the brightly-lit corridor leading
to the Royal Box, stood Sir Owen Frazer, and he was
laughing—laughing, it seemed, as a man had never laughed
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until that moment his feelings had been entirely of self-reproach.
He had acquired the bitter knowledge that a
great chance had been given him—the chance for which he
had waited all his life—and he—he couldn’t deal with it.
To-morrow evening the public would witness an exhibition
so execrable, so vile, that the veriest tyro might be
ashamed of giving it. But the sight of Sir Owen Frazer’s
mirth brought about an instant metamorphosis. The self-reproach
vanished, to be supplanted by a dull and smouldering
rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With compressed lips he made as if to approach the
Knight; then, turning about, he swept superbly from the
stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back at his hotel he came to a great decision. Failure
on the morrow was certain. Well, fail he might, but not
on the lines of Raymond Wakefield’s laying. London
should see Eliphalet Cardomay play Cellini on his own
methods—play it, in fact, just as he had played “The Silver
King,” and a hundred other creations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rehearsal was called for his especial benefit next day,
but he telephoned to say that he had no intention of being
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond Wakefield got into a cab and set forth to see
what it was all about. He found his quarry, arrayed in a
gorgeous kimono, discussing a late breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, here, Mr. Cardomay,” he began, “do you consider
this is fair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet motioned him to a chair and placed cigarettes
within easy reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear young Mr. Raymond Wakefield,” he said, choosing
his words with slow deliberation, “I have no intention
to rehearse again, because it would be useless. You, with
unexampled brilliance—and, believe me, no one is more sensible
of your admirable gifts than I am—have devoted an
entire week in a fruitless endeavour to teach your grandmother
to suck eggs. Doubtless grandmothers should know
how to perform this delicate ritual, doubtless it is expedient
and is expected of them; but many are too old to learn,
and, right or wrong, prefer to decapitate the ova with a
table knife and assimilate its albuminous contents with the
aid of a teaspoon. I have done my best, and have failed—confessedly,
I have proved an inept pupil, and, to
complete the metaphor, have dribbled the yolk and the
white all over my waistcoat like a child that knows no
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear chap,” exclaimed Raymond Wakefield, striking
one hand against the other, “if only you would play Cellini
as you are talking now, I’d turn into a door-mat for
you to wipe your feet on. Now, let’s run over it just once
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet Cardomay was adamant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Connaught’s Theatre was packed to overflowing
for the opening performance of “Benvenuto Cellini.”
Incidentally, every member of the dramatic profession,
not otherwise engaged, made it a duty to be present,
some even going to the extremity of paying for their seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news that something unusual in the way of acting
was likely to occur had spread with the rapidity of a fire.
Be it said that most of his fellow-players were heartily
sympathetic with Eliphalet for the failure they were confident
he would make, but their sympathy did not take the
form of staying away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the curtain rose, each member of the company
came forward to wish him luck, and he, with old-world
courtesy, thanked them all and waited, apparently unmoved,
for his cue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first scene in which he was to appear was a very
Rabelaisian interlude wherein he made love, of a base
kind, to his model. At rehearsals he had been worse in
this than in any other part of the play. His efforts to
acquire a light touch had been little short of bricklayer’s
pastry, and the poor girl with whom the scene took place
was in an agony of dread at the coming ordeal. What was
her amazement, then, when Eliphalet Cardomay acted the
whole racy interlude as though he were reading a lesson
from the Bible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the audience did not know what to make of it,
the reading was so utterly at variance with the lines. Then,
like a wave, it struck them that here was originality at its
highest. Here in these full-throated accents, these absurd
parsonic gestures, was a brilliant satirical reading—a fragment
of exquisite characterisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an ovation when Eliphalet left the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the author’s box Sir Owen Frazer was heard to say,
with extraordinary force, considering he had lost his voice,
“I’m damned! Damn it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oscar Raven plucked Wakefield by the sleeve. “What
on earth do you make of it?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will make the play,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t understand. Does he know what he’s
doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course not. Our friend Eliphalet is shirking. He
couldn’t do what we wanted, so he’s just turning on the
old stuff, the old provincial tap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then please Heaven,” came from Franks, “he keeps
up the flow till the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did. All the bad provincial fake was reeled off—mere
vocalisation and attitudinising, utterly misplaced,
fitting the part nowhere, and for that very reason accepted
by the high-browed Press and the novelty-seeking public as
one of the finest dramatic conceptions of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Press raved about it. They went into ecstasies over
the Art of Eliphalet and his “epic cynicism.” “Why had this
marvellous depictor been denied to London?” they cried.
“Doubtless,” said one, “much praise is due to the intellect
of Mr. Wakefield, the brilliant producer, but for the actor
himself no adulation could be too strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the “brilliant young producer” kicked himself heartily
in that the praise should have been due to him for casting
Eliphalet as Cellini, but that he had forfeited all claim
thereunto by losing sight of his original intention out of
pique.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wonderful notices were brought to Eliphalet on the
following morning as he lay in bed, and very gravely he
read them through—and understood. There was no triumph
in his eyes—the meaning of those cuttings was too
clear. To Eliphalet they spelt failure, not fame. The
words “epic cynicism” rang through his brain. Epic cynicism?—Yes,
it was just that. And instead of rising, as for
years he had dreamed he would do, and saying to his image
in the glass, “Eliphalet, old boy, we’ve knocked ’em—knocked
’em hard,” he pulled the coverlet over his head
and buried his face in the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Benvenuto Cellini” ran ten weeks, during which time
the secret of Eliphalet’s success was well preserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly enough, Sir Owen Frazer, whose voice by this
time was restored to him, was singularly free from enthusiasm
with regard to the hit his <span class='it'>confrère</span> had made. People
even went so far as to say that, had he been a lesser
man, they would have suspected him of jealousy. Thus
there was a good deal of astonishment when it became
known that he had offered Eliphalet Cardomay the second
lead in his new production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet received the part in company with an invitation
to supper. He went over it very carefully and very
suspiciously. Then he put it in his pocket and went forth
to seek Raymond Wakefield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read this,” he begged, “and open up your wonderful
brain as to its potentialities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond did so, and explained with fluency and clarity
the thousand subtle intricacies with which the part abounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Owen Frazer is a very clever man,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way back he returned the part, with a polite
refusal to sup. In a postscript he added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am returning to the provinces for good. One should
never destroy an illusion. You have had your laugh. It
was generous of you to wish to share it with the masses.”</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay stepped from his first-class compartment
to the platform. Potter, his dresser, having descended
from the train while it was still in motion, respectfully
held open the carriage door lest his august master
should soil his beautiful wash-leather gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear me! this sounds strangely familiar. Why, of course!
That’s the worst of starting a story at the wrong end.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PISTOLS FOR TWO</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Let us avoid repetition, and return to Eliphalet Cardomay
where we left him at the dining-table, to march
backwards to a past episode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lack of concentration and cohesion are among the chief
snares lying in wait for him who chronicles character
rather than plot. One might, of course, hazard, by way of
excuse, that the recently recounted reminiscence was of
greater interest than a detailed account of a roast leg of
lamb followed by black-currant tart would prove. But
justifications are always dull. To Eliphalet Cardomay the
London episode was a grief unspeakable, whereas the homely
repast, consumed in such familiar and well-loved surroundings,
was the very reverse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He finished that black-currant tart unto the final morsel,
till naught but the permanganate-coloured stains upon the
plate remained in token of its recent being. There was
something almost boyish in the liberality of his appetite. In
using the term boyish the period of his own youth is not
implied, for Eliphalet displayed no youthful traits until his
hair was silvered, his brow furrowed, and his eyes deep-set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are certain men whose mental condition bears
little or no relation to their years, and he was one of them.
They are born with grown-up minds, sage and mature convictions,
unsuited to youth and only really serviceable when
they have reached that time of life with which such gravity
accords.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay, even when a boy, was oppressed
with a middle-aged manner and a professional mien. It
might truthfully be said that his brain and body did not
synchronise until he had passed the forty-year high-water
mark. His body, or, to put it more gracefully, his externals,
were prepossessing. His broad forehead, swept-back
hair, bold eyebrows and dilated nostrils, gave suggestion
of virility and power. To a maiden they were productive
of second glances, an added colour and a quickening of
heart-beats against the ramparts of her corsets. In this
well-knit yet æsthetic youth she might be pardoned for presuming
there lurked wells of high romance, tempered with
humour and a knavish disposition. It was said of him
in the company, where he played juvenile leads at two pounds
two shillings a week, that he was “deep.” Furthermore,
since it was never his custom to boast about deeds of love,
the young men with whom his lot was cast credited him
with the proclivities of a Lothario and laid to his account
many charming indiscretions in the glades of Eros. The
older members of the company were wiser, or deemed themselves
to be, and decided, not without a certain rough
justice, that he was a bit of a prig. For this reason, Harrington
May, who specialised in villains of the heavier
kind, gave him the title of “Mother’s Boy” and named
him as such to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was very grave (he had accomplished the forty-five
manner twenty years before he was entitled to it), and
replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In so far as I was born of woman your accusation is
correct. My mother died, however, when I was a year old.
I presume, from your smile, you believe you have said
something offensive, but since it is nothing but the truth
I cannot allow myself to take umbrage, even though the
truth is usually a stranger to your lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one so young the speech was painfully pedantic, but
it succeeded in putting Mr. Harrington May temporarily
out of action, and established for Eliphalet a reputation
for caustic repartee. He was frequently asked to repeat
his words, but this he politely declined to do, thus giving
further proof of age before accession to age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Blanche Cannon, a depictor of adventuresses on
the stage and a great Bohemian off, had been present at
the contretemps, and was greatly delighted by the young
man’s urbanity and calm. It is no infrequent occurrence
for opposites to be attracted by each other, and she, with
her scatter-brained, love-a-lark disposition, scented in Eliphalet
a suitor of possible quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, poor fellow, was quite unaware of this, for his
thoughts were centred in Art and a desire to make a mark
in dramatic history. Hitherto he had had no dealings with
love, and many a maid had languished in vain on that
account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Blanche was not of the languishing brand. Having
decided to ensnare his affections, she set about making
inquiries, and was greatly intrigued to learn, from several
misinformed, but talkative, young actors, that he was
“no end of a dog on the Q.T.” One of them, with an imagination
that would have thriven in Fleet Street, went to the
length of describing a <span class='it'>liaison</span> with a certain titled lady,
who had become enamoured of Eliphalet from the stalls
and had lured him away to a castle, beside which Haddon
Hall paled into insignificance. Charmed by these accounts,
Blanche Cannon’s desire developed exceedingly, and forthwith
she began a tentative archery upon the heart of Eliphalet.
It is always your student who proves the easiest
prey to the wiles of love, and one day, when she had successfully
manœuvred a tête-à-tête tea-party in her own
rooms, Eliphalet succumbed, and Blanche, picking up her
cue with professional skill, dropped into his arms under a
smother of kisses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was entirely proficient in the art of love-making.
It was part of his equipment as an actor. He knew
the moment to fold to his bosom the form of an adored
one, and how to brush the hair back from her forehead
with just sufficient pressure to elevate the chin to the ideal
angle for imprinting a kiss. He knew how to drop his
voice to a quality of whispering and passionate vibration.
All of these services he most faithfully rendered, with one
or two minor improvements suggested by a productive mind.
Repetition, however, if pursued beyond a given margin,
is apt to weary the soul, and after a while Blanche began
to yearn for variety, and to doubt if he were indeed the
ideal lover. Certain misgivings also arose in his own mind.
At first he was enveloped in the wonder of love new-born,
but as time went on he was able to detect certain faults
in the poetic composition of his destined bride. For instance,
she did not respond very rapidly to the Shakespearian
atmosphere he diligently sought to produce by passionately-delivered
quotations from <span class='it'>Romeo and Juliet</span>. She showed
a marked lack of interest in the story of Abélard and
Héloise, and a greater enthusiasm at the prospect of a
donkey-ride on the New Brighton sands than a lovers’
wander in leafy solitudes. She became sick of holding
hands, and more than once told him stories the humour of
which would have been better suited to the court of Bluff
King Hal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a sensitive mind these passages of wit were distasteful,
but nevertheless Eliphalet Cardomay remained in love
with praiseworthy constancy. He built palaces, masoned
and mortared of their united talents, and spoke of the
future that should be theirs—a future which would be
spoken of in retrospect by posterity. With love and
guidance he convinced himself that Blanche would in time
come to a fuller understanding of the vast responsibility
they jointly held for the furtherance of art. He pictured
her as blossoming into a great emotional actress, and to
that end tried to dissuade her from over-hilarity in public
places, and to attach less importance to such trivial pleasures
as ice-creams consumed in small Italian cafés. He
spoke of the glory of mutual understanding, reciprocity,
and many other long-worded matters, tedious to a person
of light-hearted habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her part, Blanche was heartily disappointed that
none of the alleged characteristics displayed in the affair
of the titled lady had been revealed to her. His behaviour
had been of a scrupulous purity, and high-standing little
short of ridiculous. It has been said that Blanche was
a Bohemian, which implies a taste for the savoury diet.
She enjoyed risky friendships—she liked to see the eyes
of her lover catch fire and to quell the fire by some cold
drench of inconsequent nonsense. That was caviare! There
was a relish in such intimacy—but with Eliphalet, and
his erotic quotations, there was none. Wherefore, partly
to stimulate more vivid emotions, and partly for her own
entertainment, she adopted other methods, and in Mr. Harrington
May and his natural villainies she found the desired
means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May was a heavily-built man with a hearty laugh and
a bullying manner. He bullied his juniors and his lovers
alike, and by so doing achieved something of a reputation
for manhood. His principle in life was to take his fun
where he found it, so, accordingly, when Blanche yearned
towards him, he threw an arm around her with a strong
man’s zeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t see what you found to amuse you in that young
spring poet,” he observed, after the first elaborately-resisted
embrace had been achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway,” returned Blanche, who was a firm believer in
tantalising methods, “he scored off you all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harrington May did not deny the charge, but “I’m scoring
off him pretty heavily at the moment,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, that night, Eliphalet suggested to Blanche they
should take sandwiches and aerated waters and have a picnic
in the pleasaunces of Jesmond Dene the following day,
she shook her head and declined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my dearest, there will be no rehearsal, and you
and I could——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve something else to do, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was very mysterious and roguishly declined to tell
him what. Eliphalet, unlike most youths, was not in the
least suspicious, but he thought it a strange violation of
true love’s laws to harbour secrets. When he observed as
much, she put him off with a coquettish toss of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the next couple of days each proposed meeting met
with the same answer, and at last he began to feel angry
and injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being of a philosophical mind, this sense of injury found
expression in more practical ways than upbraiding his
<span class='it'>fiancée</span>. He reflected that, if after so short a time she was
able willingly to forego the charms of his company, it was
reasonable to expect that serious breaches would arise
should they engage upon more enduring relations. This
reasoning led to the natural conclusion that Blanche Cannon
was not the right woman to fill the post of his wife
and helpmeet. It would be better, perhaps, to tell her so
at once, rather than increase the embarrassment by untimely
delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts were occupying his mind when Blanche
herself pushed open his dressing-room door, and, violently
rubbing her cheek, stepped inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a nice lover, aren’t you?” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have tried to be,” he replied evenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you haven’t succeeded. My idea of a lover is a
knight in armour who protects his fair lady, not you. You
sit down and shut your eyes to what’s going on in front
of your nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand, my dear. You had some secrets,
and I did not like to intrude on them without your permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and I suppose you’d wait for my permission before
going for a man who tried to kiss me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet rose and compressed his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one would dare with the knowledge that we are
engaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t they, just! Well, they just have—at least
one has, the vile brute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A member of this company kissed you against your
will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d do nothing if I told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” repeated Eliphalet, very white and calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harrington May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I shall know what to do, my dear. Your
honour is quite safe with me; and mine—mine has been
outraged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw open the door and closed it crisply behind
him, leaving Blanche looking a little scared. She had not
counted on producing the quality of dull anger his face had
worn, but thought rather he would fly into a boy’s rage—caress
her with a savage intensity and curse the man who
had sought to steal her favours. Then she would have
told him that the whole thing was a joke, devised to buck
him up and make him amusing. Afterwards, they would
have gone out and had a jolly good beano. But somehow
his looks did not give encouragement for such a recital,
and, moreover, she felt a stirring of admiration for
the manner in which he had strode to confront his rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet went straight to Harrington May’s room and
entered uninvited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leading-man was removing his make-up, and he
looked up over the brim of a very dirty towel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you want?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eliphalet answered coldly enough:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a blackguard—a low, thieving blackguard. A
man to whom honour is a thing unknown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very pretty,” said May. “Did you write it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dared to kiss my future wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harrington May rubbed his face thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and who would that be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I refer to Miss Cannon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah! I see. And I’m supposed to have kissed her,
am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you deny having done so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must make quite sure before answering. There’s
a note-book in the pocket of that jacket, if you’d pass it
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet picked up a pair of gloves and flung them
into the leading-man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! Go easy! What’s that for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a challenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A challenge, eh? To what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To a duel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harrington May threw back his head and laughed aloud,
but for all that he scrutinised Eliphalet shrewdly from the
corner of his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the challenged party, it is your right to choose the
weapons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, so it is. I haven’t fought a duel for a week
or two, so I’d forgotten. What do you say to crossbows?—or,
if they don’t suit, I’m a pretty good hand with the
lasso.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The choice lies between pistols and swords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May flashed another quick glance. Certainly the young
man appeared to be in earnest—but the whole thing was
absurd. He was on the point of selecting swords, as the
first word to come to hand, but decided hurriedly against
doing so. It was conceivable Eliphalet, in the heat of his
anger, might snatch up a sword and make a dig at him. In
the course of one or two previous productions they had
fought a few stage-fights, and Eliphalet Cardomay had
rather a pretty knack with a blade. Pistols and the
thought of speeding lead would very soon destroy the foolish
ideas that were possessing him, thought May; so with
a world of dignity he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I choose the trusty old bundook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will meet at midnight by the ruined mill in Jesmond
Dene,” said Eliphalet, and walked sedately from
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harrington May sat motionless awhile, regarding his
own image in the glass. He felt oddly cold, and his jaw
showed a disposition to tremble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” he said, squaring his shoulders. “This is
silly! That young upstart is trying to bounce me. Well,
we must come back on him heavily, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and finished dressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the stage-door a few members of the company had
gathered, and an inspiration seized him to narrate what had
occurred. So, with plenty of noise and a liberal allowance
of margin for his own repartee, he recounted the side-splitting
exchanges that had led up to the challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think, boys?” he shouted. “It’s pistols
for two, at midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a chorus of “No,” “Chuck it,” and “You’re having
us on, old man,” he responded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Solemn fact, I give you my word. We meet in Jesmond
Dene at the witching hour of twelve. Coffee for one
at five past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before had the company enjoyed so rich a jest, and
they fell about in ecstasies of rib-punching laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I saw through it,” said May, “though he played
his bluff well. I wish some of you had been there. I was
as solemn as a judge. Lord! it was funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you think he was bluffing, then?” asked a very young
man, whose name was Manning, and who secretly harboured
admiration for Eliphalet Cardomay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t <span class='it'>think</span> about it, darling,” responded May, and
was greeted with a fresh burst of merriment, in which all
but the aforesaid youngster joined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ’ud be funnier still,” he ventured, “if it turned out
that he wasn’t bluffing at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one took any notice of that aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do, Mr. May?” asked one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall turn up, of course, dear boy, and, like as not,
catch a cold waiting half the night, while our little friend
is sleeping in bed. Tell you what: this joke is too big to
keep to oneself. I’ll pay the hire of a wagonette, then you
can all slip off after the show and see the fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This spirited offer was received with enthusiasm, and the
whole company was on the point of repairing to a hostelry
to honour the occasion, when Eliphalet Cardomay, carrying
a small polished wooden case, came quietly through the
stage-door. At his approach the conversation died abruptly,
and all eyes were turned upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please,” he said, asking for a gangway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone touched his shoulder, and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fighting a duel to-night, old man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. May will answer that question,” he replied, and
passed into the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I tell you?” demanded May in his loudest
tones. “Isn’t it wonderful, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you notice what he was carrying?” said very
young Mr. Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say I did, unless it was a soother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had that old case of pistols from the property-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn good!” roared May; but the laugh stuck in his
throat somehow, and lacked the quality of genuine mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gifts bestowed by the gods upon Eliphalet Cardomay
did not include a very generous measure of humour,
or he would scarcely have set about his preparations with
such precision and calm. Bearing the case of old pinfire
revolvers, he entered a gunsmith’s in High Street, and
asked for cartridges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shop assistant examined the bore of the weapon
and rummaged about among his stock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think these’ll do,” he said, “but it’s an old pattern
pistol, and this stuff has been lying around some years.
We’ve a range at the back, if you’d care to try a few shots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should, very much. Perhaps you would lend me a
wire bristle—these barrels are a trifle rusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having little to occupy him, the amiable assistant spent
half-an-hour in cleaning up the old weapons, and succeeded
in imparting to them a greatly rejuvenated air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t get much shooting in your line, do you?” he
asked. A provincial shopman recognises, by a kind of
second-sight, every touring actor and actress who visits
the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have practised a little,” returned Eliphalet, “for you
cannot use a weapon effectively on the stage unless you are
acquainted with the right method.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They descended to the basement, where there was a
miniature range, lighted with little whistling gas-jets. The
assistant hung a target to a clip and despatched it on a
drawn wire to its appointed place. Eliphalet loaded the
pistols, and balanced them critically in his hand. Then,
laying one aside, he drew a bead and pressed the trigger.
The bullet cut the inner line at twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throws up a shade,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His second shot perforated the bull very neatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s sound shooting,” exclaimed the astonished assistant.
“Try the other one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little to choose between the two revolvers, and
when all ten shots had been fired, the target presented a
very pretty pattern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve a steady hand. Before I saw this I thought actors
lifted their elbows too much to shoot that way. I like
your light hold on the butt and the thumb straight with
the barrel—it’s stylish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet thanked him for his praises, paid for fifty cartridges,
and after carefully cleaning the two weapons, bade
him good afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took his meal at a chop-house, and ate but sparingly.
When he had finished, he called for paper and an envelope,
and wrote a farewell letter to Blanche, to be delivered should
misadventure overtake him. It was rather a grandiose composition,
in which the word “honour” recurred with some
frequency. He placed it in his pocket, paid the bill, and
walked to the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of the challenge had spread like wildfire—even
the stage hands and cleaners were in possession of
every detail. Wherever he went he was followed by curious
glances, and often after he had passed explosive but suppressed
giggles would break out. It was clear the company
was treating the affair as a joke. Personally, he
could see very small provocation for laughter, but reflecting
that with trivial minds mirth and calamity are close
companions, he made no comment. He wondered whether
Harrington May would laugh next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had quite made up his mind not to kill his
antagonist, but to place a bullet in his thigh, trusting this
would prove sufficient punishment to meet with the requirements.
He wished almost that the cause of their quarrel
had been a woman of finer fibre, but that could not be
helped, and the insult to his pride was the same in any case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The business of the play proceeded on even lines. A
private affair could not be allowed to interfere with a public
duty; but once or twice he stumbled with his words and
missed a cue. Harrington May observed this, was delighted,
and noisily declared in the greenroom, during one of his
waits, that “Mother’s Boy” was in such alarm that he
couldn’t “talk straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wagonette had been ordered, and towards the end
of the play had drawn up in a side street to wait the coming
of the revellers. Nearly everyone had brought with
them a warm coat or wrap, that the elements might not
interfere with their perfect enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the curtain fell on the last act, Eliphalet carefully
dressed himself, and was on the point of leaving his room,
when Blanche came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a little fool, aren’t you?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is discouraging for a man about to risk his life for a
lady’s sake to be addressed in such terms. It was a time for
guerdons and not rebukes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what manner am I a fool, Blanche?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Challenging May to a duel, like that. Everyone knows
about it, and is laughing about it, too. Now, I suppose
you are going to walk home as if nothing has happened. A
nice idiot it’ll make me look, and you’ll be the laughing-stock
of the theatre for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why couldn’t you punch his head, like a man, and leave
it at that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not consider to do so would be punishment enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than all this silly talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been very little talking; indeed, I ought not
to be talking now. There is not much time before the—the—appointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche’s eyes sought his face with quick interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cardy!” she exclaimed. “You’re not serious? You
don’t really mean to——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—you can’t—you mustn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can and will. There is no going back now. Please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she barred his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—no! I forbid you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you’re joking—joking! You couldn’t shoot him—not
for that. Besides, you wouldn’t know which end
of the pistol to hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man who is playing a part senior to his years will
generally give himself away on a detail. It was sheer
youthful arrogance when he drew from his pocket the target
he had decorated that afternoon, and cast it on the table
before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did this at fifteen paces,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The message of the target was plain, and Blanche needed
no second glance. She flung herself at her lover’s feet,
and besought him to spare the life of Harrington May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It—it wasn’t all his fault,” she sobbed. “I did egg him
on a bit, just—just to stir you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he was silent, and his face was ominously
stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You achieved your object,” he replied at last. “We
must talk more of this later, Blanche. For the rest, you
need not be alarmed. I shall not kill this man, and you
are free to take what is left of him, when I have finished.”
Thrusting her aside, he picked up the case of pistols and
hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God!” cried Blanche, and there was admiration as
well as fear in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was rather wonderful that he would risk death for her
sake—but of course it must not happen. She must go at
once and warn Harrington May of the danger. Then came
the thought, “Suppose he, too, insists on fighting?” Her
eyes glittered. This drama that centred about her was
fantastic, thrilling. If he, too, were determined to enter
the lists, where would her choice lie?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corridors were deserted, for the company had dressed
hurriedly and were well away towards the sheltering bushes
of Jesmond Dene. As she hastened towards May’s room
she could hear Eliphalet Cardomay’s fly rattling over the
cobbles of the street below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hulloa!” exclaimed May. “Not gone to the party? Better
come in my cab. Pity to miss the fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t fun,” she cried. “He’s in deadly, awful earnest.
He’s going to shoot you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leading man licked his lips and smiled queerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t bounce me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear it. I’ve just left him. He’s gone there with
the pistols, and he can shoot straight—terribly straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it isn’t a joke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A joke! He’ll kill you. Oh, Harrington, you must fly—get
away—hide somewhere. Look: it’s Saturday night.
I’ll let you know if it’s safe to come back on Monday—but
you must go now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, if it’s like that, I will,” gasped May, and
reached for his coat and hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t face him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not looking for a funeral. Thanks for telling me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he clattered down the corridor, Blanche called the
word “coward” after his retreating form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very formidable and grim young man who, half-an-hour
later, alighted on the fringes of that pleasant dell
known as Jesmond Dene. Under his arm he carried the
case of pistols, and the lines about his mouth were set
and hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will wait,” he said, addressing the cabman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I won’t,” returned that gentleman, who was
unaccustomed to so direct an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet did not deign to reply, but he turned aside
from the road and stepped briskly down the steep and
wooded path. The moon shone serenely, casting dark
violet shadows of the trees upon the grey undergrowth. He
knew the way, for this had been a favourite seclusion when
learning new parts, and took a short cut to the appointed
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes May,” whispered one of the concealed company
from his observation-post in the bushes. “Keep your
hands down, you chaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet passed within a few feet of several unseen
onlookers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That <span class='it'>was</span> May, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t see his face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Manning spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wrong. It was Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a ring of triumph in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk rot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look for yourselves, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet stepped out into the clearing, and the light
of the moon showed his features with a ghastly precision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the girls gave a nervous laugh, and several men
turned to each other with apprehensive glances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, he’s turned up!” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is going too far,” said another. “We ought to
stop it. Here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hand was clapped over his mouth by Harrington May’s
staunchest supporter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t spoil the fun. He’s only bluffing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Manning spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish I knew which way they are going to stand,” he
said. “Likely as not one of us’ll pick up a stray bullet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing which, Miss Mary Neville, the ingénue, did
what she was accustomed to do in plays on such occasions—fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away in the distance the Town Hall clock struck
twelve. There was a general rustle, as everyone verified
the time by their own watches in the little patches of
moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If May finds him here there’ll be trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P’r’aps he won’t come,” volunteered Manning, and was
advised to avoid folly and stupid speculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet laid a white kerchief on the ground—stepped
out fifteen paces, and dropped another. Then he took out
the pistols and examined them. This he did at the precise
moment Miss Neville emerged from her faint, and
caused an immediate relapse. Satisfied that all was in
order with the weapons, he laid them on the top of the
case. His actions were very concise, and he appeared quite
composed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fact is, he guesses we’re here, and he’s putting up a
big bluff,” whispered Harrington May’s supporter into a
convenient ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was silence, faintly disturbed by the rustle
of the breeze and the clucking of water dripping from the
mosses of the old mill-wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet removed his coat and looked at his watch. Ten
minutes past twelve. The waiting was trying his nerves.
There should be strict punctuality in an affair of honour.
He began pacing up and down, slowly at first, but later
with a savage intensity of movement; when the quarter
past chimed, he tossed his head angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t make out what’s become of May. He was almost
dressed when we left the theatre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps——” began Manning, then stopped as the noise
of approaching wheels and hoofs cut crisply into the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet heard it—drew a sharp breath, and squared his
shoulders in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excitement among the spectators leapt to fever-pitch
as they heard the vehicle come to a standstill. There immediately
followed the patter of running feet and the smart
crackle of breaking twigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes turned towards the path as Blanche Cannon
burst into view. Without a second’s hesitation she flung
herself into Eliphalet Cardomay’s arms, gasping and crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my hero, my darling hero! He was a coward—he
wouldn’t meet you—he’s run away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the exquisite relief of the moment Eliphalet folded
her to his breast in a sobbing ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the company, who had remained silent for longer
than their natures allowed, broke cover and surrounded the
happy pair with a chorus of hand-shaking, back-slapping
congratulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the enthusiasm subsided, which was not until three
a.m. that morning, for everyone crowded to Eliphalet’s room
to do him continued honour, he was rather dismayed to find
that he and Blanche were destined, by pressure of opinion,
to be made man and wife before the month was out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surmise, therefore, O wise and prophetic reader, the disastrous
results, not alone confined to Art, that so often
arise from humouring the popular prejudice in favour of
a Happy Ending.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CURE THAT WORKED WONDERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Of all conventions a happy ending is the most perilous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It intrigues people into the most improbable situations.
It fawns upon the unthinking and offends the
thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happiness should arise from natural causes, and never
be induced for the purposes of convenience or climax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay’s early life was saturated with plots
which, passing through a morass of many tribulations,
invariably ended with lovers embracing. It was as much
the inevitable outcome of this saturation that led him
to commit the fatal error of making Blanche Cannon his
wife as it was to slacken his waistcoat after a repast
and sink, with drooping eyelids, into a chair beneath an
open window. The first was the accepted happy ending to
a love episode, and the second the plethoric happy ending to
a meal; and in neither case did the results justify the action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His marriage ended sordidly in a cheap divorce; and his
siesta, the one on that particular afternoon, in a cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Treacherous germs await old gentlemen who sleep beneath
open windows. Riding at ease with the army of
descending smuts that denote the industry of a Midland
town, they enter the system and take command. Wherefore,
ten days later, instead of walking with sprightly step
down Brigan High Street, Eliphalet Cardomay was lying
in bed, contemplating M. Dyson, of the Royal Theatre,
Brigan, with a pleading and watery eye. But the manager
was not a man to allow sentiment to stand in the way of
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any other night, Mr. Cardomay,” he said, “I’d have
bitten on the bullet and said, ‘Stop away’—but this is our
biggest business day in the calendar, and if you go out of the
bill .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He finished the sentence with an expressive
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Eliphalet, propped up with a pillow and two cushions
borrowed from the sofa belowstairs, looked pained as
well as old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe me,” he plaintively remarked, “I feel very ill.
I don’t think I could play the Reverend Barnard Coles to-night,
and I know I couldn’t do him justice. Really—really
I should be grateful if you did not press me further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last thing I should dream of doing. Only it comes a
bit hard on me, after booking you solely for that date.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It being obviously useless to appeal for sympathy, Eliphalet
fell back on his second line of defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, don’t you see, the entire dignity of the part would
be gone if he were played with a cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” declared Mr. Dyson. “What’s to prevent
the Reverend Coles, or old Hamlet himself, for that
matter, from blowing his nose like any other mortal? Now,
you take my advice—lie in snug all day, and have some
rum and milk, and a couple of boiled onions for lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a teetotaler, Mr. Dyson, and also a rigid abstainer
from onions, not so much from personal distaste as from
the knowledge that he whose breath is impregnated with
the aroma of that vegetable loses both friends and prestige.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Mr. Dyson’s face brightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove,” he exclaimed, “I saw a guaranteed cure in
yesterday’s <span class='it'>Herald</span>. Tip-top thing. Breaks the back of
the worst cold in four hours. No humbug! There are
photos of people who’ve benefited by it—in the Ad.” His
lynx eye lighted on a copy of the journal in question at the
moment Eliphalet was drawing it into concealment beneath
the quilt. “Hi! you’ve got it there—half a minute—now,
listen.” And, shaking out the folds of the crumpled news-sheet,
he began to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Baxter’s testimony on Enoch’s Instantaneous Cold
Cure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There followed a letter in which the good lady set forth,
with great lack of reserve, the painful and familiar symptoms
of her malady, stating how, after a night of darkness,
an angel from Heaven (disguised as a next-door neighbour)
appeared, and urged her to try Enoch’s Instantaneous Cold
Cure. Whereon she, despaired of by the luminaries of the
faculty, secured a phial of the magic decoction, which not
only dissipated the cold, but actually relieved her of an
almost chronic dyspepsia and a lifelong tendency to sciatic
rheumatism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that?” demanded Mr. Dyson, in
conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am too familiar with the form to be greatly impressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you try a bottle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had very much rather not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dyson’s mouth shut like a trap. “Comes to this,”
he said. “You won’t try to help me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor invalid waved his head from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well,” he conceded. “I’ll take it if it gives
you any satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the style,” cried the manager. “I’ll get you a
bottle right away. Mark my words, you’ll be fit for anything
by night.” And, slapping a hat on his head, he
clattered from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was back five minutes later with a neat chemist’s
parcel in his hand. “Bought one for myself, too,” he said.
“Felt a bit snivelly this morning. Now, come on and have
a dose at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just had a little beef-tea,” replied Eliphalet, “but
I promise to take it in half-an-hour. In the meantime, I
believe, with your assistance, I could snatch a few moments’
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t see how I can help in that direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not,” said Eliphalet; “but I daresay if you
left me alone I could manage it by myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Righto! See you at the theatre, then. Don’t forget the
physic, mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did forget. It was eleven o’clock when Mr. Dyson
left, and it was after five when Eliphalet awoke from a profound
slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was quite dark, save for the light from a street
lamp which percolated through the muslin curtains and
cast strange shadows on the ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes. The troublesome
itching behind them had abated. His nasal passages were
clearer—they actually admitted air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I am better,” he said. Then, striking a match,
he lit the gas-jet by the bed, and looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quarter past five! Old boy, if we are going to play
to-night, we had better get up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very unwillingly he withdrew his feet from the cosy coverings
and, as he came to a sitting posture and made a tentative
search with his toes for the carpet slippers, his eyes
fell upon the little paper parcel where Mr. Dyson had left
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, I have broken my promise!” he exclaimed.
“I must take the stuff at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up the parcel, broke the pink string and extracted
a small blue glass bottle bearing a label covered
all over with microscopic print.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, the question is whether I should not be just
as well off without this,” he mused. “However!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He withdrew the cork and smelt the fluid critically. It
had rather an agreeable smell—slightly sickly, perhaps, but
on the whole pleasant. In placing it to his lips, he observed
the label.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people would read that,” ran his thoughts, “but
as it probably deals with just such another case as Mrs.
Baxter’s, I think I won’t.” And he swallowed the contents
of the bottle unto the last drain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The action was typical of Eliphalet. Small details, not
connected with his calling, he invariably ignored. They
fidgeted and oppressed him, and it is probable, but for the
zealous attentiveness of his dresser, Potter, he would have
strode the streets with buttonless clothes and laceless boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly Potter would never have allowed his master to
consume a bottle full of unexplored liquid without first
ascertaining in what measure it should be taken. But Potter
had been summoned to the bedside of a departing aunt,
and Eliphalet, confronted with the problem of “doing for”
himself, had set about it by the shortest route.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Messrs. Enoch had expressly stated on their unread label
that not more than thirty drops should be taken at a single
dose—and not more than three doses <span class='it'>per diem</span>. “Taken in
excess,” so ran the legend, “the cure might have effects prejudicial
to the system.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roughly speaking, Eliphalet Cardomay had consumed
some three thousand drops, and already their subtle powers
were at work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being a strict teetotaler, and unfamiliar with spirituous
influences, he was at once sensible of exhilaration and a tingling
warmth in his vitals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With feet dangling, he sat on the edge of the bed, blinking
and clicking his tongue against the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An original flavour,” he soliloquised. “Yes—I think I
like it.” Then, donning a dressing-gown, he crossed to the
fireplace and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saakes alive,” said the worthy Lancashire landlady, “ye’ll
never be goin’ to get oop with that ’eavy cold an’ all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Duty before ailments,” observed Eliphalet gravely.
“May I have a can of warm water here, and a plate of soup
and a rack of toast when I come downstairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the water arrived, accompanied by advice to get
back to bed, he set about to shave a twenty-hours’ stubble
from his chin. It was a spasmodic effort, and he reflected
how rapidly his cold had pulled him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are getting old and palsied,” he confided to his
reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While washing, he experienced a novel and peculiar sensation—just
as if all his nerves were transmitting electric
messages to their various centres—messages which seemed
to run, “I’m having a riotous time here—what’s the news
with you?” Moreover, he had a curious conviction that his
brain-cells were opening and closing in the most unusual
way. Little glimpses of long-forgotten incidents raced across
his mental screen, to disappear or be obliterated by some
succeeding impression. During the process of putting on
his collar and tie quite right such pictures came and went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw himself as a tiny boy, dressed up in a white suit
and white shoes and socks, going to a circus with his father.
He remembered how Eliphalet No. 1 had stopped to speak
to a friend, and how he had filled in the weary wait by paddling
through a four-inch slough of mud, swept up by the
roadside. He was on the point of laughing at the recollection
when it struck him that there was nothing to laugh
at in a man’s last words to his wife—how vividly the trumpery
appointments of that room recurred to him, and the
silly threats she had made—and how—they applauded on
his first appearance in “The Corsican Brothers.” He had
held his head high that night, and the pavement outside the
stage-door was thronged with an eager and waiting crowd,
and—all the theatrical profession were there when Eliphalet
senior was laid to rest. “A Great Tragedian,” old Toole
had said, and he had replied, “A wonderful father, sir.” And
what a night of it they had (the early ’seventies, wasn’t it)—He
and a dozen other bloods put a barricade of beer-barrels
across the top of the Hay-market—Jermyn and Panton
Street—and no one was allowed to go past without a drink.
He was not a teetotaler then. That had been proved by the
magistrate’s comments at the Police Court on the following
morning. How his head had ached. Was his head aching
now? Not a bit—a little dizzy, perhaps—that was from
the cold—but the cold was better—much better. Fine stuff

<p class='pindent'>He stooped to pick up his hat, and kicked it clown-fashion
right across the room. A second effort was more successful,
but, oddly enough, the pattern of the carpet photographed
itself vividly upon the retina of his eyes. He was
still aware of it when he returned to the perpendicular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were angles and shapes in yellow and green on a
red ground which danced before them as he descended the
stairs—the stairs that had such an awkward twist he had
never before noticed. “They tell me,” he gravely announced
to Mrs. Beecher, who had come into the hall at the sound
of his approach, “they tell me that one of the most difficult
achievements is to put a spiral staircase into perspective.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye—well, a’ve put soup on table; you ought to take
cab to theatre,” responded the good lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was touched to a point of exaggeration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a happy and fortunate man your good husband is
to possess such a wife.” And so saying, he took his hat
from the hall stand and went out into the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keen evening air felt like a cool hand upon his brow,
and Eliphalet hummed to himself as he went. He turned
into the High Street as the Town Hall clock struck six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six! He was very early. The curtain didn’t rise until
7.30, and a quarter of an hour was ample time to assume the
clerical garb of the Reverend Coles. Wherefore he had a
full hour to spend as he liked, and it was a delicious evening
for a walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the fringe of factory chimneys lay rolling downs
and green valleys—valleys with light-hearted brooks chuckling
among the stones. Years had passed since he sat beside
a brook, with the water thrilling his bare toes—and all of
a sudden a great desire possessed him to be alone in a solitude
of water and willows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a policeman standing a few paces away, and
to him Eliphalet said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you direct me to a valley with a stream running
through it—where I can be all to myself—alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The policeman, a broad-beamed Lancashire lad, regarded
him suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can tell you where you’ll be alone all right,” he responded,
“and happen you’ll find yourself there sooner than
you expect unless you get a move on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, look here,” said Eliphalet very seriously. “When I
was a younger man I used to count the buttons on policemen’s
coats.” And with this grave admission, he turned
away. He had not gone more than twenty yards before
his attention was attracted by two small boys and a little
girl, their noses glued to the windows of a confectioner’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hungry?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All three turned their attention from the magnetic charms
of mince-pies and Maids-of-Honour to the æsthetic and
deeply-seamed features of Eliphalet Cardomay. There was
something in his countenance which at once dispelled any inclinations
to tell untruths. It was such an open and kindly
face—like that of an old baby—and the child he had addressed
turned from the contemplation of it to judge the
effect his words had made upon the other two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the little girl replied, “Noa, us isn’t ’oongry, but
us cud do wi’ soom of they there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So could I,” said Eliphalet. “Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the head of this little ragged band he entered the shop
and addressed a comfortable looking matron who was arranging
macaroons on a glass stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have come to eat cakes, madam,” he announced.
“Chelsea buns, tarts with jam on them, doughnuts and sweet
almond biscuits. We are not hungry, you understand, but
we want these things, for the children do not know their flavours—and
I have forgotten them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the good lady, who was a motherly soul, established
them at a little marble-topped table and brought many delicacies,
and Eliphalet, an Easter cake in one hand and a
marzipan potato in the other, began to talk. He told them
many little incidents of his own childhood—his voice sounding
very far away. He told them the plot of <span class='it'>Julius Cæsar</span>
and how he would like to be a grandfather—or a father—and
what he intended to put on for this spring season, and
about a villa at New Brighton where he would live when
he retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the while the children swallowed the cakes and
thought him amiable but mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was seven-fifteen when the feast was suddenly broken
up by the violent entry of Mr. Dyson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had called at Eliphalet’s rooms and learnt of his
unusual departure, and when the actor did not put in an
appearance at the theatre, had hastened out in great alarm
to search the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was sheer luck that I saw you through the window,”
he cried. “Do you know what the <span class='it'>time</span> is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I, since it waits for no man?” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got barely ten minutes to get on the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This startling announcement brought Eliphalet abruptly
to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me! I had forgotten. There are so few children
in my life. Madam, please,” he placed half a sovereign
on the counter, and shook his head at the proffered change.
“Give it to them in a bag. Come, Dyson. Ten minutes, you
said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they hurried from the shop one of the children asked,
“Is yon his keeper, missus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dyson gripped him by the arm and dragged him
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gave me the scare of my life. How did you come to
overlook what the hour was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I must have done,” replied Eliphalet hazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope you took that stuff all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I think so. Fancy I ought to have another dose.
Let’s stop and buy some more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No time. I’ll give you some at the theatre. Hurry
along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The local dresser was not a man of marked intelligence
or great celerity of action, but he contrived to get Eliphalet
into the outer coverings of the Reverend Barnard Coles in
less than quarter of an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dyson, busily employed in the front of the house,
sent round his bottle of Enoch’s Instantaneous, half of which
Eliphalet drank. He would probably have drunk the rest,
had not the cork been pushed inwards and floated across the
neck of the bottle before he had finished the contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before his entrance, Mr. Dyson rushed round with
a few words of warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clinkin’ house,” he said. “Packed out—but they may
want holding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thass all right—we know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feeling pretty good in yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet took a deep breath, closed his eyes and exhaled
heavily. At that instant he heard his cue. Alert at once,
he opened the door and walked on to the stage. The lights
dazzled him. He was struck with a consciousness of something
left undone. What was it? Ah! he had failed to
answer Mr. Dyson’s question. Wherefore he promptly
replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I feel rather funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the usual burst of complimentary applause,
and in an instant he was the Reverend Barnard Coles, about
to be deserted by wife and child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet played the first act of “The Broken Heart” very
cautiously. Without suspecting that anything was radically
wrong with him, he felt that he must be wary. Once or
twice his articulation had struck him as peculiar. He had
shied badly over the word “constantly”—“consanny” was
the nearest approach he had been able to make to the correct
pronunciation. Then again, sundry speeches had become
unexpectedly involved. For example, he had to say, “You
with your great eyes, your scarlet mouth and your white
face, are ever before me, a barrier which shuts me off from
God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he actually said was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, with your white eyes—your great mouth—and
your scarlet face,” etc. Fortunately he had put so much
passion into the lines that no one noticed the slight confusion
of adjectives. That is to say, no one on the audience
side of the curtain; but Freddie Manning, the stage-manager,
who had known Eliphalet as a man of temperance
during a constant association of countless years, tipped his
bowler hat to the back of his head and quoted briefly from
the Bible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Syd,” he said, addressing the call-boy, “slip along for
a glass of cold water and stand with it at the door the
Guv’nor comes off by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The call-boy grinned and went on his errand whistling
a song, the words of which dealt with the pleasures of
alcoholic excess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catching the implied suggestion, Mr. Manning, nothing
if not loyal, directed the toe of his boot at the seat of the
young musician’s trousers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say! What’s wrong with the Guv’nor?” asked the
lady who played the villainess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, my dear,” was the curt reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s been saying the most extraordinary things,”
she persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has ’e? Well, don’t you bother about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This conversation took place just before the series of
events leading to the finale of Act I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene, as written, ran thus: The worthy Vicar,
deserted by wife and child—beset by an intriguing
woman—sinks down before his writing-desk and buries
his face in his hands. After a few seconds of silent agony
he rises, straightens himself—like a man determined to bear
his burden with unbent back—and strides from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner has he gone than two paid desperadoes make
burglarious entry by the French windows, and steal from
his safe papers proving him to have been guilty of a crime
years before. As they are escaping, the Reverend Barnard
Coles returns, and cries “Who’s there?” He tries to arrest
their flight, and is brutally struck down.—<span class='sc'>curtain.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when the wicked lady left the stage, on this particular
night, Eliphalet was perfectly clear about what he had
to do. It was the author’s intention he should stagger to
his writing-table—and stagger he did, most realistically.
He supported himself with one hand and switched off the
table lamp with the other, leaving the stage in darkness, save
for the crimson rays from the fireplace, which encarmined
his form during the few moments of grief and prayer before
his exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the reduction of the light Eliphalet experienced a
totally unlooked-for sensation in his head—a dizziness, a
vertigo. He sank into the chair and buried his face, and
then——</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would not dream of suggesting any reader of this story
would be likely to have personal knowledge of the sensations
which sudden darkness brings to persons who have
over-stepped the margins of sobriety. I am credibly informed,
however, by contrite, but experienced authorities,
that peculiar and various illusions occur. As a general rule,
either the floor comes up, or the ceiling descends, and this
with a rotary and oscillating motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long as the darkness prevails there is no escape for
the unhappy sufferer, and, strange to say, he is seldom wise
enough to escape from the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay had not been drinking. On the other
hand, who but an analyst could say what potent drugs went
to the manufacture of Enoch’s Instantaneous?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had his head fallen into his hands than he
felt himself borne aloft—spirally ascending to some giddy
pinnacle, rising above and above the level of earthly clay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not combat the forces at work—they were irresistible.
He could only cling to the edges of the writing-table
and wait—and, waiting, ascend. “And singing, ever
soaring—and soaring as thou singest,” he quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A frantic assistant stage-manager deserted the prompt
corner and grasped Freddie Manning by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Guv-nor’s stuck on,” he gasped. “Ought to have
been off half a minute ago. Looks as if he won’t move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning dived into the O.P., and took in the situation
at a glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I ring down?” queried the A.S.M.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Check your red arc in the fireplace. Here, you
chaps,” he addressed the two burglars. “Go and pretend
you don’t see him. Play the scene quiet, and just as you
come off, spot him and use the life-preserver. Got it? Right
away, then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was Napoleonic in crises, was Mr. Manning. “One
could always rely on Freddie,” was a byword in Cardomay’s
company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two miscreants climbed noiselessly over the window-sill,
just as the audience was beginning to find the
Reverend Coles’ anguish a shade protracted; with panther
steps they approached the safe, inserted the key and withdrew
the incriminating papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the while Eliphalet clung on to the table and
wondered where he was and what strange machinery was
hoisting him heavenward. He solved the mystery at the
exact moment the thieves had finished their work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in a lift, that fierce little lift at the Army and
Navy Stores. He was a liftman—he had been a liftman
for years. In another half-second they would arrive at
the first floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed back his chair with a clatter—flung up his
head, and the words rang out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the drapery, stationery and ironmongery departmins——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affrighted burglars staggered back as Eliphalet rose
to his feet, and cried, “This is the jewelry, toys, games, and
saddlery departmins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hindmost burglar pushed his companion forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slash him, Jake!” he hissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blow was struck—Eliphalet fell, and with him the
curtain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up went the lights, and Freddie Manning rushed on to
the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No calls,” he shouted. “Clear, everyone. Strike, boys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big scene flats split up into sections and marched
miraculously away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Guv’nor.” He stretched out a hand and helped
Eliphalet to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Eliphalet in a dazed sort of way, “I am
not very well to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re all right,” said Manning. “I’ll give you a hand
to your dressing-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-way down the long stone corridor Eliphalet hung
back and resisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno whether iss struck you, but I think we’re having
an allfully jolly evening, ol’ boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get changed,” remarked Manning grimly, and
handed him over to the dresser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he returned to the stage he found several members
of the company talking together in animated whispers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He at once projected himself into their midst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I hear man or woman saying the Guv’nor’s drunk,” he
said, “he or she gets the sack—quick. Got that?” And,
cocking his hat over his right eye, he marched off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the curtain the simple audience were discussing
the play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he mean when he says that bit about the drapery
department?” demanded the young lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her companion shook her head darkly, and volunteered:
“It’s the grief ’as turned ’is brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that must be it. Gone loopy like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet, in his dressing-room, was in a fine rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get that cork out, d’y’hear!” he admonished. “How the
deuce am I to take med-cine with the cork in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A didna knaw tha wanted any more,” said the dresser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’S no excuse. Get it out! My cold’s worse—mush
worse. Le’s have it.” And, snatching the bottle, he knocked
off its neck and drank what remained of the fluid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’ seem to—t’understand I’m a ver’ important
pers’n—great actor—Eliphalet Card’may. You’re a low feller—but
a good chap—one of the nicest and mos’ delightful
chaps I ever met——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Second act beginners, please,” yelled the call-boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet passed a hand over his brow. “Dear me!” he
said. “I dunno. Yes, yes—I’m coming—I’m all ri’, qui’
all ri’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he made his way to the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a Herculean effort he struggled through Act II. His
voice was a shade thick—his gait a thought unsteady—his
rendering distinctly heterodox; but the audience was mainly
composed of simple, uninitiated folk who accepted what
was placed before them without much questioning. They
had been assured for three weeks past, on every hoarding
in the city, that Eliphalet Cardomay was a great actor.
And since the ways of the great are ever incomprehensible,
it behove them, as groundlings, to give genius its due and
applaud exceedingly at the end of the act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unhappily, Mr. Dyson, manager and part owner of the
theatre, did not reflect the feelings of his supporters. He
had seen the act, with growing indignation, and realised
he was not getting what he had paid for. In short, that
Eliphalet Cardomay was giving a rotten show for the simple
reason that he was “boosed.” Mr. Dyson was not a
man to shirk duty, however unpleasant it might be. Accordingly
he hurried round to Eliphalet’s dressing-room,
pushed open the door and stalked inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get out,” he said to the dresser, and when the
man had gone, “Look here, Mr. Cardomay. You’re boosed—<span class='it'>boosed</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boosed” was a favourite word of Mr. Dyson’s, and,
on certain occasions, a favourite pastime. This circumstance,
however, did not make him any more tolerant of
the failing in others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was lying full-length in a dilapidated arm-chair,
his hands hanging limply over the sides. Certainly his
general appearance gave ample excuse for Mr. Dyson’s
charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through a mental fog he became vaguely aware of the
manager’s presence. With a faint smile he murmured:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whassay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re boosed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boosed? Who’s boosed? Wha’s boose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are—and you’ve got to pull yourself together. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet blinked, then sat upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” he exclaimed. “D’you sugges’ I’m drunk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it—and what’s more, the audience’ll know it, too,
if you aren’t jolly careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old actor rose to his feet, his face working as under
a great emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dare say that t’me! I—I’m a tee-to-tootler—for
twenty—twenty-five years. Loathe drink—nev’ touch it.
I’m—I’m one—one—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re one of the rowdy-dowdy boys to-night,” cut in
Mr. Dyson crisply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fog descended again, and Eliphalet swayed on the
back of the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tha’s it,” he said. “One of the dowdy boys—all in a
row.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dyson flung open the door, shouting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your understudy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Freddie Manning came down the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the row?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s drunk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop that,” said the loyal S.M.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was leaning on the door, and he sang:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then next morning before the beak we’re feshed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s ill,” came from Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ill! He’s boosed, and I won’t have him go on—see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning shoved his hat on the back of his head
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he is, no one is going to say so before me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s his understudy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look after the front of the house and leave the
back to me. Clear out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s blind to the wide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning jerked back the cuff of his sleeve and shut
his teeth tight. The faces of the disputants were barely
two inches apart. The dresser came into the room, and
Eliphalet passed noiselessly out. Chuckling stupidly, he
made his way to the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take up the curtain,” he ordered, and the assistant stage-manager,
accustomed to years of implicit obedience, touched
the bell, and the curtain rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me,” the dresser was saying. “A doan’t think
t’ poor gentleman’s droonk. A think t’is physic as ’as oop-set
’im. ’E’s been taking doases very free from this ’ere.”
And he held aloft the empty bottle of Enoch’s Instantaneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage-manager seized the bottle and read the label.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he take the lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and another bottle beside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drugged!—p’raps he’s killed himself.” Then, in a roar:
“Where the hell did he get the stuff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dyson fell back a step and covered his mouth guiltily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?” Manning jerked out the monosyllable threateningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did mention—I—I told him it was good,” faltered
Mr. Dyson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Freddie Manning, “you’ll go right on before
the curtain and tell the house just exactly what’s happened.
The Guv-nor’s going home to bed right now, and,
look here again, you’d better state the facts pretty lucid,
for I swear I’ll break your neck if it gets about that the
Guv’nor was tight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the distance came the sound of a mighty roar of
laughter. Simultaneously they turned and saw, for the
first time, that Eliphalet Cardomay had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s on!” exclaimed Manning and, followed by Mr.
Dyson, made a dash for the wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was on! That was the opinion of the entire audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the great dramatic moments of the play had been
wrecked and lay in splinters on the stage. A scene, the
moving nature of which would have wrung tears from a
stone, had, by a single line, been turned into an ecstasy of
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife and child of the melancholy but Reverend Coles,
having seen through the falsity of the life they had chosen,
and battered by the glittering villainies of Black Moustache’s
patent leather boots and doubtful champagne, had
returned weepingly, to implore his forgiveness and his blessing,
and he, instead of replying, “I forgive and bless you,”
had smiled idiotically and said, “Chase me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house rocked and fell about with laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unprecedented success of his sally made a profound
impression upon Eliphalet. He saw himself as a comedian—a
funny man. The last of his self-control fell from him,
and he gave himself over to rickety horse-play and clumsy
mafficking. He overset chairs and tables, and laughed
stupidly, He turned tragedy into farce, and the Reverend
Coles from a figure of pathos became a figure of fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “mother” and “daughter,” friends of many preceding
tours, strove nobly, but without avail, to keep the
scene together, and were eventually driven from the stage
in desperation, and genuine tears. Then the temper of the
audience, who knew real tears from the acted variety, underwent
a complete change, and became nasty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ee! Tha’s droonk, man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame to un! Pull un orf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Booooo-booooo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ought to ’ave our money back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comin’ on like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoiling of a fine play!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get orf—get orf!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sling summat at un!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame! Booooo! Ssssss!!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the tumult progressed Eliphalet leaned upon a
palm pedestal and surveyed the house with a mystified
expression. He thought they were applauding him, and
bowed his acknowledgment (incidentally knocking over
the palm and pedestal!). There was a fresh uproar. Evidently
they were not applauding—something must be wrong.
What? He held up his hand, and his great bass voice
rang out with unexpected volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” And they were silent. “I was warned you’d
want holding, and I’ll hold you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout of derision was hurled from the gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll hold you yet,” said Eliphalet, rocking to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a carrot whizzed through the air and fell with a
plump at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A carrot! The vegetable of derision—the symbol of
contempt—the food of asses—to him, Eliphalet Cardomay!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the mists cleared from his brain and the waywardness
from his limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies—gentlemen!” he cried. “I am ill—very ill!
I can’t understand—never—never before have I failed my
audience. Let me finish the play—give me a hearing, or
break my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a lull, and Freddie Manning, in the wings,
seized the character with whom the next scene was played,
and with, “Get on and don’t give him time to think,” hurled
him on to the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice before the end of the act the mists rose before Eliphalet’s
brain, but he battled them down by sheer force of
will, though the effort brought beads of sweat to his brow.
With grim determination he hammered out his lines until
the last one had been spoken, and there remained naught
else but the heart-attack—the clutching at his breast—the
broken cry of “Mary!” and the fall into peace—oblivion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain had barely touched the boards before Mr.
Manning had thrust the manager before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Mr. Dyson, “I have not
come here to make an apology, but to say that you have
been privileged to-night to witness a performance under,
perhaps, the most remarkable circumstances under which
a man has ever appeared.” And to the best of his ability
he told them what had happened. When he had finished
it was obvious to the meanest intelligence that the applause
savoured of the sceptical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t do,” said Freddie Manning, and pushed his way
before the footlights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy there! You’re not going yet,” he cried. “Some
of you believe it was a yarn the manager has just put over.
But I tell you it’s true, and if any man here to-night goes
home and says that my Guv’nor and my friend, Mr. Cardomay,
was drunk, he’ll be steering a straight course for
the libel court—and what’s more, he’ll get this,” and he held
up a closed first with a row of shiny knuckles turned outward.
“He’ll get this between the eyes—an’ that’s a promise
I’ll keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right into the hearts of those hard-bit Lancashire lads
went those “straight-flung words,” and such a roar of enthusiasm
followed them as would have wakened the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it failed to waken Eliphalet Cardomay, who lay on
his back and snored, with his head on a rolled-up stage cloth
and his mouth wide open.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ELIPHALET TOUCH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay was not, in the true sense
of the word, a Bohemian. In his own particular way
he was rather conventional. He knew he had not been
drunk by any intentional intemperance of his own, yet the
memory of the affair at Brigan was a nightmare to which
even Manning was not permitted to refer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a man who has formed for himself certain high standards
of behaviour, even the inadvertent collapse of any one
of these is a matter of acute distress. Eliphalet Cardomay
hated insobriety. The word conjured up in his mind a
vision of a last scene in his married life. He regarded
drunkenness as the thief of virtue, and with Eliphalet
virtue was of supreme account. So far as lay within his
power he suppressed any tendency in his company toward
what is inaccurately termed by laymen, “theatrical arrangements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prevent some little wanderer from committing a false
and foolish step he would take any amount of trouble. Eliphalet
Cardomay was, despite the failure of his own marriage,
a romanticist. He would gladly walk ten miles to
a wedding, and an equal distance on his hands to a christening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a sentimental kink in most childless old men.
A wise and loving parent Eliphalet Cardomay would have
made, had the fates not willed it otherwise, for he was the
very type of sentimentalist who gladly would have given
his every possession to have his dress-tie—on the rare occasions
he wore one—tied by dainty daughter-fingers. But
no daughter bore the name of Cardomay—he was alone and
self-contained, and watched all around him a world of
apathetic parents seemingly insensible to the happiness that
was theirs. And so, in his little way, Eliphalet fathered
his flock, guided and ferried them over rough waters, gave
them gentle, easy advices, and, without saying much about
it, contrived to do a deal of good.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Some girls are always old enough to be on their own—others
are never old enough to be on their own, even when
middle-age has made their girlhood a sham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the latter order was Miss Eunice Terry, whose real
name was Mary Kent. She became Eunice Terry on her
accession to the stage because she foolishly believed such
verbal extravagances would facilitate her ascent of the
ladder of Fame. The foolishness of Eunice did not stop
with her choice of a name, for the stage had scarcely
claimed her as its own before she adopted the practice of
calling everyone “My dear,” of colouring her naturally
pretty face with unnatural pigments, and of wearing clothes,
and particularly boots, of a type which no man admires, except
on evenings of frivolity removed from the home circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Eunice Terry been a wise little girl she would have
remained Mary Kent even though on the stage. For Mary
Kent was quite an attractive person, and far more likely
to figure in the cast of a play than any amount of Eunice
Terrys. But she was not a wise little girl, she was a very
foolish one, and her folly was the cause of a growing grief
in the heart of Henry Churchill, who had loved her with
joy as Mary, and continued to do so with melancholy as
Eunice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry Churchill was a big, conventional young man,
with a disproportionately small salary derived from an estate
agent. He had first met Mary when the latter was
employed by the same firm as typist, and had succumbed
at once to her fascinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spent four delightful months getting engaged, and,
after working hours, would sit on the pebbles of Bognor
beach and make delicious plans for the future. There was
only one cloud to dim the skies of these pleasant discourses,
and that was Mary’s constantly expressed ambition to go
on the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have gone ages ago,” she would say, “if it
hadn’t been for Auntie, and you know what she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Henry secretly thanked Heaven for Auntie, for,
knowing nothing whatever about the stage or stage-folk,
he very properly disapproved of both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Auntie, it appears, was the stumbling-block to many joyous
enterprises. It was she who insisted that he must earn
fully two hundred a year before she would consent to the
match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary wants any amount of looking after,” she said,
“and you’re not old enough yet to look after yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A premature marriage was thus averted, and the young
lovers consoled themselves by privately condemning Auntie’s
tyranny and common-sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day Auntie died, unexpectedly and inconspicuously
on the horsehair sofa in the parlour, and Mary Kent
was left alone in the world to work out her own destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might be imagined that Henry embraced the opportunity
to make her his wife then and there, but Auntie had
left, by way of a legacy, a certain amount of the one-time
detested common-sense. Reviewing his financial position
by the clear light of before-breakfast sunshine, he was forced
to admit that a salary that barely sufficed to satisfy his
own needs would inevitably prove insufficient for two. He
conveyed this weighty decision to the ears of his adored
one, who, deprived of the same clarity of vision that had
been given to him, accepted it as a token of waning affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can’t keep me,” she sobbed, “then I’ll keep both
of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sorely perplexed, he asked her what she meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall go on the stage and earn a huge salary, and
then perhaps you’ll be sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk like that, Mary,” he begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always meant to go when Auntie died, as it makes no
difference, anyhow, and now I shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These remarks being somewhat involved, Henry Churchill
scarcely knew how to answer, so he said the worst thing
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how you can go on the stage without knowing
anything about acting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do know something about it, and when you see me
driving about in my carriage I sha’n’t take any notice of
you, and that’ll pay you out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry pondered for a moment before replying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you have more respect for your poor aunt’s
memory than to go talking about carriages, like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mary only pouted, and never said another word
during the whole walk home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning Miss Mary Kent’s place at the estate
agent’s was unoccupied, and when Henry, after an agonising
three hours, rushed round to her abode, he found a letter
awaiting him, the gist of which was she had gone to make
her fortune on the stage, and though she would always love
him she must give rein to her artistic abilities before the
consummation of their happiness could be achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginner’s luck is no fable, and it was certainly exampled
when Mary Kent presented herself at the stage-door
of the Theatre Royal, Brighton, at the psychological moment
Eliphalet Cardomay decided that another lady-guest was
required for the reception-scene at the Ambassador’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Brighton <span class='it'>Herald</span> had commented upon the quality
and lack of guests in this important function, and Eliphalet,
viewing the scene from the wings, was bound to confess
there was justice in their observations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not pleasant for an actor of his standing to read in
the “What People are Saying” column that “The Ambassador
at the Royal this week hasn’t many friends, and
what he has hardly seem worth knowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a general rule, guests can be made to double in other
acts with peasants, gardeners, or policemen, but in this
particular play there were no peasants, policemen, or gardeners;
hence, to invite more than a select few to the Ambassadorial
rout was a distinct extravagance. Nevertheless,
it would not do if people got hold of the idea that he
was cheese-paring. Accordingly, at the end of the matinée,
he called the stage-manager, and addressed him as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Manning, you will endeavour to find a girl and a
young gentleman to walk on in the third act; the stage is
not sufficiently dressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are, Guv’nor,” said the stage-manager. “There
was a girl asking for a job at the stage-door five minutes
ago. Nip down the road, Sydney, and try and catch the
young lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sydney, the call-boy, departed with speed, and came up
with Mary at the corner of the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Guv’nor wants to have a look at you, miss,” he
said. “Might be a shop going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With fluttering heart Mary retraced her footsteps, and
was led by Sydney to that most hideous of structures, the
back of the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was all wonderful to Mary, especially when she
found herself within a few paces of the great Mr. Cardomay,
irreproachably attired in evening-dress, with a velvet
collar, and wearing many mystic orders on his white shirt
front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning detached himself from his employer, who
melted into the wings, and, twisting the card she had left
at the stage-door between forefinger and thumb, approached
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the tyro Mr. Manning was rather terrifying. His
bowler hat, which he always wore either on the extreme back
or the extreme front of his head, seemed menacing, as also
did the extinguished cigarette which stuck to his lower lip
and engaged upon the strangest evolutions as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-e-es,” he said, looking her up and down. “Um! Of
course I know what you can do. What have you done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said Mary, startled into speaking the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning sucked his teeth and shook his head. At
this juncture Eliphalet Cardomay appeared from behind
the scenery, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Manning, make the engagement. She will
enter after the French Consul and his wife—cross down
right and sit in chair below settee until music cue, then off;
on again at finale by door right. Walk it through and see
the wardrobe-mistress. Tell Boscombe to make a duration
of tour contract.” And without another word he vanished
into the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I really engaged?” panted Mary. “Is it a good
part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No worse than other walk-on,” replied Manning. “Come
on through this door; you’ll have to go on to-night, and I
want some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is questionable whether the inclusion of Miss Eunice
Terry at the Ambassador’s reception greatly improved the
scene. For certainly never was a guest more awkward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With jealous amazement she viewed the natural ease of
the other young ladies in the crowd, and envied them their
mellifluous laughter. Earlier in the evening she had listened
with awe to the conversation in the dressing-room, and had
marked how each, according to her own tale, was usually
to be seen in highly important rôles, but being sick of “resting”
had accepted a “walk-on” as a “fill-in.” From the
way the Christian names of stage celebrities flew about
Mary judged them to be well in with the <span class='it'>élite</span> of the profession.
After a few days she learnt that it was not essential
to be personally acquainted with such persons as Julia Neilson
or Marie Löhr, before speaking of them as “Julia” or
“Marie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These familiarities intrigued her greatly, and before the
week was out she was able to refer to H. B. Irving as “Harry”
or Dion Boucicault as “Dot” without the slightest embarrassment.
Eliphalet Cardomay was the only person
never spoken of by an abbreviation. He was and remained
“The Guv’nor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning, the stage-manager, automatically became
“Freddie,” not to be confounded with Fred, which, as everyone
knows, was reserved for Fred Terry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Freddie” was the subject of much conversation, indeed
about forty per cent, of the entire output either started
with “Freddie is a brick, you know,” or “Freddie is a perfect
beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another twenty per cent, was given over to the doings
of the call-boy, “that little devil, Sydney,” and the remaining
to reminiscences of past successes, or such remarks as:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a perfect rag to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen the show at So-and-so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, he was perfectly awful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was nothing but paper in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I always do love Marian; she makes me cry, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s such a dear off the stage.” And so forth and so
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harmless stuff for the most part—not, as a rule, scandalous—always
and without exception vapid and silly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are dear, kind-hearted, empty-headed little ladies
who sail their boats round the fringes of the lake of dramatic
art. They belong to a <span class='it'>genus</span> of its own. They never
play parts—in the main they couldn’t if they tried—in
the main they don’t want to. They are content to talk
big, to walk on and on in one “show” after another, until
at last they have walked away their good looks and disappear
to an even greater obscurity than that of the peasant
or the guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eunice Terry was not in all respects the counterpart
of these other girls. At least she was ambitious. She desired
success, fame—that is to say, she desired the advantages
these conditions carried with them. It did not occur
to her that to be successful and beloved of the public one
must give the public something by way of return. She was
out for her chance without even considering whether or no
she would be able to make good if she got it. So, instead
of thinking about her profession, she devoted herself entirely
to acquiring silly habits of speech and little vulgarities
of attire which robbed her of all her good taste and most of
her good looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day Eliphalet Cardomay engaged her he made the
following note in a little book kept for that purpose. “18th
January. Engaged Eunice Terry. A guinea for eight performances
and one-fourteenth for any addition. Looks
about twenty years of age, pretty, slightly wistful; evidently
inexperienced. Might be suitable for very sympathetic
parts. Note: the name Eunice Terry seems strangely out
of keeping—Dorothy or Mary would be more appropriate.”
Having made this entry he forgot all about her until one
day when he decided to revive “East Lynne,” and then,
in looking through his first-impression book for a suitable
“Joyce,” the faithful nurse, he came across the paragraph,
and at once dispatched the call-boy for Mr. Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manning,” he said, “I’ve been thinking of Miss Terry
for the part of Joyce. Is she still with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Guv’nor. Of course, we’ve never tried her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That should hardly matter. I have a note here that
she is simple and sympathetic. With these attributes the
part will play itself. Will you send her to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tremendous flutter in the dressing-room when
Mr. Manning popped in his head and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guv’nor wants to see you, Miss Terry. Look slippy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eunice, dressed for the street, felt her hour of triumph
was at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d only known in the morning,” she gasped, “I’d have
put on my fawn coat and skirt. This old thing’s a rag.
Does this white fox look dirty, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you look sweet, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Followed some frenzied powdering—some dexterous
touches with a be-rouged hare’s-foot—the borrowing of a
pair of white gloves from one girl, “that lovely parasol” from
another, and a hurried departure to meet her fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door of Mr. Cardomay’s room she halted. It
would not do to appear flurried. She must be calm and
remember all the wonderful things she had learnt during
the last six weeks. She must stand her ground as an artiste,
and it was comforting to reflect upon the irreproachable
plinth provided by her patent-leather boots, with the uppers
that soared upwards to the height of her knee. She
knocked, and heard the answering “Come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cardomay was engaged in writing in an autograph
book as she entered, and he laid it aside and turned his
eyes towards her. What he saw seemed to surprise him, for
he contracted his brows a little. He had expected to find
the same little rosy-cheeked runaway from Bognor, but, instead,
here was a young lady all over white fur, white boots,
white powder, long gloves and short skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some mistake, I think,” he said. “I asked for
Miss Terry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Eunice Terry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tch-tch! dear me, you will think it very strange that
I hardly know the young ladies in my own company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not at all,” she replied. “One knocks up against
so many people on the road, doesn’t one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded gravely. Evidently the young lady was
no use for the part, but, being kind-hearted, he hardly
knew how to get rid of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent for you,” he said untruthfully, “to ask if you were
any relation of the Terrys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eunice’s high hopes came down with a bump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really a relation,” she answered. “Of course, we
know Fred very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um!” said Eliphalet. “Well, I trust you’re happy in
the company. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eunice turned to go, then, with sudden courage stayed
and said: “I was hoping, Mr. Cardomay, you had got
something for me in the next show. I’m simply dying to
play a part—a big part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unsatisfied fatherly instinct in Eliphalet Cardomay
came to the surface, and pointing to a chair, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down a minute. How old are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m twenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you a father or a mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I used to live with an old aunt. She was a frightful
ogre, Mr. Cardomay. Wouldn’t let me go on the stage.
So silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity. And you are not engaged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, only in a way. I don’t think I shall ever marry
him; not, at any rate, until I’m famous. You see, he’s
foolish about the stage, too. Seemed to think it would spoil
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet’s eyes wandered to the white boots elaborately
displayed for his benefit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor young man,” was his comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a great dear, of course, and I like him very much,
but I couldn’t let him stand in the way of my career, could
I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad you agree with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Real love does not stand in the way of an artistic
career, it advances it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m madly keen to get on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call getting on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean to have one’s name and photograph in all the
papers, to keep a motor, and be recognised—all that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet smiled ironically. “At least it was an honest
answer,” he said. “The last girl to whom I put the same
question replied: ‘To play Lady Macbeth better than anyone
else.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How silly!” said Eunice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eliphalet rose to put an end to the interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you will have something for me?” she
hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Advice at any time you need it, and, as a little to go
on with, don’t lose track of that poor young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone had waited in the dressing-room to hear the
result of her interview, and a salvo of “Well’s” and “Did
you fix anything?” was fired from the expectant circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather not say,” she answered evasively. “He particularly
said I mustn’t mention it to anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were brave words, and brave also was the gaiety
of the song she sang as she left the theatre. But that night,
after the gas had been turned out in the lodging she shared
with another girl, Eunice Terry found herself crying, and
seemed in no great likelihood of stopping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flora Wayne, her companion, heard the sobs in her sleep,
and, instantly sitting bolt upright and wide awake, as only
a woman can, demanded what was the matter. Whereupon
Mary Kent forgot that she was Eunice Terry, and whimpered
with piteous grief, because she hadn’t got on and
didn’t understand why Mr. Cardomay should have sent
for her and given her nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t I get on?” asked the tear-stained one pathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Flora, like the fool she undoubtedly was, whispered
various reasons by which, according to her study of human
beings, it appeared that to rise upon the stage was only
possible for those who consented to fall in other ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the only way to get a start,” said Flora. “Because
I wouldn’t take it is why I have always stuck where
I am.” And having sown the canker of this perilous seed
in the fertile soil of the silly little brain beside her, Flora
turned over and continued her broken sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eunice lay awake and turned the matter over in
her mind. It was a disturbing thought that art and virtue
could never be allied, and she wondered very deeply if it
were so, approaching the subject as fearfully as a child
with a strange dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been in Mr. Cardomay’s company four months
when this mental crisis occurred, and during these months
Henry Churchill, to bury the sorrow of her loss, had plunged
himself so deeply into work at the Real Estate Agent’s, that
he had attracted the favourable attention of his superiors.
One bright day he was sent for to the inner office, where he
found Mr. Robins, senior partner of the firm of Robins,
Robins and Crusoe, who informed him of their intention
of starting a new branch at Lancingdon and placing him
in charge, as manager, with a salary of two hundred and
fifty a year and a commission on business transacted. This
momentous interview took place on the day before Henry
Churchill’s annual holiday, and it was not unnatural, after
a night’s rest in which he set his mind in order, he should
have packed a bag and after studying a theatrical paper
hastened off to the town where his Mary was playing, to
tell her the wonderful news and seek to rescue her from the
paths of unrighteousness and sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having arrived and taken a room at a temperance hotel,
he lost no time in seeking out the theatre. To a young man
of gentle upbringing it required no small courage to turn
down that narrow alley towards the stage-door—that alley
which in his imagination was at the conclusion of each evening
performance probably chock-a-block with the gilded
youth of the city, each one bearing a bouquet of exotic
flowers designed to anæsthetise the blossom of his heart
into accepting their addresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately he was spared the indignity of asking for
her at the stage-door, for at the moment of his arrival
she herself stepped out. For a moment he failed to recognise
her—so little of the original Mary remained under the
mask of pink powder and the screen of white fox, but the
features of the little figure were the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Mary!” he exclaimed savoured more of rebuke
than recognition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s Harry!” she cried, with a genuine pleasure
in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was so shocked by the silly little changes she had
made in herself that the tone of welcome was lost to his
ears, and it was only with difficulty he restrained himself
from saying many foolish things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anywhere we could go and have a few words
together?” he gravely asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, rather! How about the Mik?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mik?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mikado,” she replied. “It’s much better than the
Royal, you know; the Royal’s always so full. Fancy your
turning up! I’m real glad to see you, boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry had never been called “Boy” before, and it grated
on his ears as the powder offended his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the way to the Mikado Eunice kept up a sharp rattle
of dressing-room remarks, about poor dear Flo who couldn’t
act a bit, but was such a dear for all that; about Sydney
Lennox, who had played second leads with Fred, and was
reported to have ticked off Dot before an entire West End
company; and endless other showy fragments intended to
impress him with the manner of her success, since the day
they had parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact she had another reason for talking,
and that was to hide her own feelings, which had been sorely
upset by a short interview she had forced on “Freddie”
Manning half an hour before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all good stage-managers, Manning assiduously
avoided persons who sought to converse with him on business
subjects—but this time Eunice had caught him unawares
at the end of a passage that led to a blank wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Manning,” she had said, “do be a dear and tell me
straight out what my chances are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning rubbed his small, round ended nose and screwed
up his features, like a child before a dose of physic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare say there’ll be a walk-on for you in the next show,”
he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I mean my chances of a part—a real part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Umph!” remarked the stage-manager. “What do you
want to play parts for, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do. Please tell me, and don’t tease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manning could be very straightforward when he
wished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Acting’s like everything else,” he said. “It’s got to be
learned. No one’s going to give you a part unless you give
something in return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a perfectly innocent speech, but, thanks to the
vapourings of Flora, Eunice Terry read its meaning all
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s the only way to get on?” she asked nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” responded Freddie. “You don’t get anything
for nothing in this life.” Then very dexterously he slipped
past her down the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry listened to her chatter with growing displeasure,
but it was not until they had seated themselves at a table
in that Japanese-fanny, coffee-smelling restaurant known
as the “Mik” that he really spoke his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, look here, Mary,” he said. “I want to talk to you
very straight. Mr. Robins has offered me the managership
at the Lancingdon branch, with the salary of £250 a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am glad!” said Eunice Terry, laying a white-gloved
hand on his sleeve. “That’s fine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The question is whether you will throw up this business
and marry me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she made no answer. Awhile she turned
over in her mind the words of Flora and Freddie Manning.
Here was this big, honest young man, who really did love
her, and there was that remote phantom of possible success,
with its barrier of the price to be paid. It would be very
nice to set up house with Harry with two-fifty a year, for
after all the thirty shillings a week she earned didn’t go
far, and really and truly there was nothing very sensational
or exciting in her present life. When she lifted her head
she was smiling very prettily, and it was on her lips to
say “Yes,” when some demon, possibly the ghost of Auntie,
inspired Henry Churchill to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if you consent, there must be an end to all
this making-up business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” gasped Eunice. “How dare you speak to me like
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s better we should understand each other. I dare say
all this is very suitable to your present mode of life, but it
wouldn’t do in Lancingdon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You beast!” she said. “If you think I’d marry you
and be a rotten little estate agent’s wife, you’re wrong.
You talk about the stage like that, and know nothing about
it. I’d be a pretty sort of fool if I gave up the stage for
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the little Mary I used to know?” inquired Henry
Churchill, employing an old formula.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t. I’ve grown up a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grown into bad ways,” said Henry Churchill, getting
deeper into trouble. “Come, come, Mary, let us forget this
unhappy chapter of your life and begin again with a clean
sheet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got a clean sheet.” She stamped her foot. “How dare
you talk to me as if I was a wicked woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am trying to prevent such a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny way of doing it. If anything does happen to
me, it’ll be your fault. I hope—I hope I go thoroughly to
the bad—just to pay you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forbid you to say such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forbid! You have no control over me. I lead my
life in my own way—with my art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considering that Henry’s main desire was to placate her
wrath, his response of “I don’t see how you can call being
one of a crowd ‘Art,’ ” was as infelicitous as you could wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary rose with the single word “Cad!” and, flinging
the white fox about her shoulders, swept from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry did not attempt to follow her, but sat gazing
into a highly-decorated coffee-cup and chewed the cud of
tragedy. The love of his life was ruined—his beautiful
image destroyed by the vile pollution of the stage. A great
resentment surged through him that such destructive machinery
should be allowed to exist to lure the righteous to
their undoing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the table before him was a throw-away of the week’s
play. He picked it up and held it at arm’s length, as though
it were a tract of the devil. The name Eliphalet Cardomay
shrieked from the page in block type. That was the fellow—he
was the man at whose door her ruin must be laid.
Henry Churchill crumpled the paper fiercely, and as he
saw the name twist up in his grasp a thought came to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, at ten o’clock, he was at the stage-door,
demanding that his card should be conveyed to Mr. Cardomay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never sees anyone till after the show,” said the doorkeeper,
and returned to his football edition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well after eleven before Henry eventually found
himself in Mr. Cardomay’s dressing-room. Possibly he expected
to see some Satanic apparition, for certainly he was a
little astonished to find himself in the presence of a grey-haired
and elderly gentleman, with a deeply-seamed face,
which he was thoughtfully wiping with a towel. Over the
edge of the towel peered a pair of shrewd but kindly eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—My name is Henry Churchill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had already gathered as much from your card.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here on a matter of very important business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are seeking an engagement, perhaps?” It was said
very kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—far from it,” replied Henry. “In fact, I may say
that I despise the stage and everything to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whimsical smile played round the corners of Eliphalet’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You appear to have chosen an odd place to make such
an assertion,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, but I didn’t come on that score. You have a
girl here named Mary Kent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here, believe me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no use denying it. She—she’s a member of
your—troupe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet held up his hand. “Mr. Churchill,” he said,
“would you mind going away and not returning until you
have bettered your vocabulary and learnt a modicum of good
manners?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distinction with which this speech was delivered
quite took the wind from Henry’s sails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I am sorry,” he said, “but what would you say if
your affianced were ruined—spoiled and painted up like a
Jezebel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you accuse me of ruining, spoiling and painting up
a certain Miss Mary Kent? Because I assure you I have
never before heard the lady’s name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know her better, perhaps, as Eunice Terry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Terry? Dear me! Really! So you are the young
man of whom she spoke. The young man I advised her not
to lose sight of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You advised her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. I sensed that you might prove a valuable
sheet-anchor to—well, rather a will-o’-the-wisp little craft.
I hope, Mr. Churchill, you have come to carry her away to
the hymeneal altar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I did come for, but, thanks to your teaching,
it’s all knocked on the head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My teaching?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Since you taught her to get herself up—talk a
lot of silly theatrical shop, and put on stagey ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear young man, those very stagey ways you speak
of are none of my teaching. Indeed, but for their existence
I might have done something to advance the little lady in
her profession. It was their presence dissuaded me and also
caused me to advise her not to lose touch with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many young and very foolish girls whom the
glamour of the stage attracts—who are in no way suited, nor
try to suit themselves, for success upon the boards. Oddly
enough, they solace their souls with trumpery talk and silly
vanities. They are good enough in themselves, but weak,
do you see? Unable to grasp the essentials of a fine picture
while hypnotised with the glitter of a cheap gilt frame.
With a little care—a little sympathy—a little tact—they
can be won away from where they are not wanted to where
they are wanted. Now I advise you to talk to this little
runaway very gently. Condole with her on the lack of
opportunity she has had, but plead your love as a finer and
greater outlet for her self-expression. Do this, Mr. Churchill,
and upon my word, within a month you’ll be happily
house-hunting, with her hand upon your arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no good,” said Henry Churchill. “I have talked to
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Told her I heartily disapproved of everything she was
doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was unwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe in saying what I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet people who always say what they think rarely have
the privilege of doing what they like. You have made a
regrettable mistake, and there is nothing left for you to do
but leave her horizon until the memory of it has vanished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to marry her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. Hence my suggestion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here: will you promise not to re-engage her after
this piece?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to get her out of this business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not achieve your object that way. She is
pretty enough to ensure her getting another engagement,
and while she is with me she is unlikely to come to any
harm. No; I shall engage her and re-engage her for one
crowd after another, in the hope that she will surfeit of
walking on, and that it will soak into her little head that she
is not destined for a great career. And now, good night, Mr.
Churchill—some matters of business——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Henry did not move at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not at all sure,” he said, “you are going about this
business in the best way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet smiled. “Of course you are not. But then
you are not a student of human nature, and by profession
I am. Good night, again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Henry Churchill disregarded Mr. Cardomay’s advice,
and wrote a letter to Mary urging her to abandon a profession
in which she was doomed to failure, and accept his
hand in marriage. This foolishly-constructed affair fired
her determination to show him, at all costs, that she could
succeed, and moreover to say that she never wished to see
or hear from him again. Both letters, in a fit of emotional
confidence, she showed to Flora, who, being a meddlesome
little busybody, decided that it was merely a lovers’ quarrel,
and determined to act as intermediary and secretly keep
the unhappy young man informed as to his sweetheart’s
doings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it was just at this critical time that Sydney Lennox
(he who was reputed to have ticked off Dot Boucicault
before a West End company) chanced to cast a favouring
eye upon the cherry-lipped Eunice. Sydney Lennox was
attracting a good deal of attention in the company, for it
was common knowledge that in a few weeks’ time he was
taking out a tour of his own. The younger members would
haunt his exits in the hope of a chance word with him, and
many there were who besought him to give them work.
Then one night, during one of his waits, Eunice boldly
bearded the lion and asked if he couldn’t find her a part
to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennox blew a cloud of cigarette-smoke towards the
ceiling and watched it disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you act, then?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m certain I could if I had the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you want me to back the chance you can, eh?”
It was not a pretty speech, but Mr. Lennox was like that.
“Nothing doing, my dear,” he finished up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Eunice, and turned sadly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the cut of her retreating little figure made
an appeal to Sydney Lennox, for he called out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Come back a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned expectantly, and he allowed his eyes to wander
over her. Certainly she was pretty, very pretty. Quite
an asset on a summer tour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got any people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I’m an orphan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On your own, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and I’m awfully keen to get on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennox rubbed his chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Find things pretty dull, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m bored to tears with being in the crowd. I’d give
anything to get out of it and play a part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would? I see—I see. Right! Well, come and talk
to me again.” He touched her shoulder with a light, familiar
touch, and walked towards his entrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later Flora noticed a great excitement in her companion’s
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Euny?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’m to play second lead in Mr. Lennox’s tour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Euny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Isn’t it splendid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Flora made no answer for a moment; then she said
very slowly, “Is it splendid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to know the terms that got you that shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eunice burst out with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me yourself it was the only way to get a start.
I shouldn’t be the first, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Flora interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you touch it, Euny,” she said. “Don’t be a fool.
You’d never forgive yourself, and it isn’t as if you’re likely
to get on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! that unhappy string! Why must all her advisers
harp upon it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it? Well, I will get on, you’ll see. I’m not going
to be an old stick-in-the-mud all my life—like—like some
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Flora wrote to Harry for the last time, and
told him the state of affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On receipt of the letter Henry Churchill went quite mad.
Seizing his hat and an umbrella, he rushed to the station
and steamed Mary-wards by the first train. Had he possessed
such a thing, he would probably have taken a revolver
rather than an umbrella, for his intentions were certainly
lethal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great length of the railway journey had the effect of
partially flattening his effervescence, and surely the hand
of Providence was evident in the fact that the first person
he met on arriving at his destination was Eliphalet Cardomay.
The sight of the old actor peaceably pursuing his
way brought about a fresh paroxysm of anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had not Eliphalet been a man of ready perceptions, it
is probable that he would have made neither head nor tail
of the torrent of reproaches and threats that fell from
Henry’s lips; but through it all he was able to discern that
here was real tragedy, and that the need for action was immediate.
With great presence of mind he piloted the distraught
young man into an adjacent dairy and, placing before
him a bun and a glass of milk, besought him to drink
and assuage his heat. And since no one can be really violent
in the butter-smelling coolth of a dairy, he managed to
extract the story and at the same time bring the narrator
to a more rational mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will leave it to me,” he said, “I promise you on
my word of honour I will put this matter right. I only ask
you to go away and wait until I send for you. Do this, and
all will be well.” Thereafter he piloted Henry back to the
station and waited until the south-bound train bore him out
of view. Then his brows came together and the lines of his
mouth hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he sent for Lennox, and after a few small
formalities, including the offer of a chair and a cigarette,
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear you are thinking of Miss Terry for the second lead
in your new production.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had thought of her,” conceded Lennox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet placed his finger-tips together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that quite wise?” he asked. “She is young and very
inexperienced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so; but one can but try her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see no reason why you should try her. There are many
others far more suitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely, but I’ve promised this girl. Of course, if
the audiences don’t like her, it will be easy enough to take
her out of the bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it? Will it?” There was an insistent note in Eliphalet’s
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would your obligation towards the young lady be fairly
discharged if you did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What obligation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be frank, Mr. Lennox, I understand you have made
certain proposals—er—conditions to her—which I regret
should have come from a member of my company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sydney Lennox rose rather stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t admit your right to interfere in my private affairs,
Mr. Cardomay. What I may choose to do or not to
do is no possible concern of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?” came the mild rejoinder. “But it happens that I
take a personal interest in this young lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” said Lennox, then added unforgiveably, “First
come, first served.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One assumes that Sydney Lennox had played in his time
many villains, for he deported himself throughout the offensive
inspired by his previous remark, with a cynical calm
little short of remarkable. Briefly and very much to the
point Eliphalet Cardomay spoke his mind, and what he said
could hardly have been pleasant hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion, Lennox bowed and walked towards the
door. Here he turned with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity so much eloquence should have been wasted.
Doubtless your next move will be to warn the little Eunice
against my machinations, but let me assure you that her
ambition to get on will certainly outweigh your most moral
representations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That being so,” replied Eliphalet, “I must think of
other means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are no other means.” And with this Parthian
arrow Lennox withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a challenge, and Eliphalet Cardomay bit his nails
over it until he was “called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While in his bath that night, after a period of much
brain-racking, the “other means” suddenly illumined his
brain, causing him to rise so abruptly that nearly a gallon
of water splashed on the oilcloth, percolated through the
ceiling of the parlour below and figured to the extent of
fifteen and six-pence on his week’s account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning he said to Manning:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to give a special matinée at Birmingham the
week after next. Second Act of ‘The Corsican Brothers’—Trial
Scene from ‘The Merchant of Venice’ and—and—well,
I shall think of something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Manning politely asked what the idea was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to—er—to try out some of our younger members.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the stage-door he encountered Miss Terry, and beckoned
her into his dressing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me you are to play a part in Lennox’s tour.
Hum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Eunice, with a slight increase of colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, in a sense, unfortunate, since I myself had possibilities
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eunice almost seized his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Cardomay,” she exclaimed, “do you really mean
that? Oh, I wish you would!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some other time, then, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, now. I’d much rather now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your contract with Mr. Lennox?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t signed one. Please——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would be a mistake, since what I have to
offer is only a single performance. Naturally, if your success
merited it, I should look after your future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her excitement Eunice rose and paced up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, please let me do it. I don’t really want to take
the other engagement—not a bit, I don’t. What was it
you thought of me for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A special matinée in three weeks’ time. Selections from
my favourite plays. I should want you for the Trial Scene
in ‘The Merchant of Venice.’ For—for Portia, in fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Portia!” repeated Eunice. “Is it a good part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has made many reputations,” he gravely answered,
without a shade of a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll accept. I’ll tell Mr. Lennox at once. Oh, thank you
ever so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there,” said Eliphalet, patting her shoulder with
a kindly hand. “Don’t be too grateful. One never knows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sydney Lennox played a losing hand rather creditably.
He even refrained from expressing his views on the reason
for Eliphalet’s action. Possibly he thought that to do so
would have reflected but little glamour on his own personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the rehearsals everybody remarked to everybody else
on the extraordinary lack of guidance Eliphalet gave to the
youthful Portia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s simply awful, my dear,” said her dressing-room
companion, “but he doesn’t seem to mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A day or two before the matinée Eliphalet sent a letter
to Henry Churchill, saying he had to give Miss Terry a
“chance.” “Doubtless,” he wrote, “you will think I am
behaving unfairly towards you by so doing, but I am convinced
that it is the wisest course. I want you to be present
and to come round after the performance (not before)
and pay your respects to the little débutante.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure of a good attendance an early-closing day was
chosen, and a general invitation issued to the Hepplewhite
Steel Works Shakespeare Society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know what they’ll think of our Portia, Guv’nor,”
said Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we <span class='it'>shall</span> know, whatever they think,” replied Eliphalet
sweetly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had chosen an act from one of his most popular melodramas
to complete the programme, and the Trial Scene
was reserved for the final item.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly it was a meaty audience who were gathered
in. The theatre was packed with a cheerful “How-do-you-do”
whistling crowd, who hurled recognitions and shrill
pleasantries from one part of the house to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second row of the stalls sat Henry Churchill. He
had the look of a man attending his own funeral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within his bosom there surged a great resentment against
Eliphalet Cardomay, a resentment which would certainly
find expression when their meeting took place after the performance.
His anger was not lessened when he found
himself greatly enthralled by “The Corsican Brothers,” and
worked up to a keen pitch of excitement by the act from
“The Weir.” It was infuriating that this shameless mummer
could be capable of inspiring sensations other than those
of disgust in his properly ordered brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he found himself overtaken by a feeling of great
nervous apprehension. In a few minutes he would be seeing
his beloved bathed in the effulgent glow of the lime—treading
the first stage of the road to ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the curtain rose on the Trial Scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be confessed, after the generous and lurid fare
that had been accorded them, the audience (not excepting
the Hepplewhite Shakespeare Society) failed to look forward
with any pleasurable anticipation to this example of
the Bard’s genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very naturally they felt aggrieved that William Shakespeare
should have been dragged into an afternoon’s entertainment,
when the time allotted him might have been
more profitably spent with the work of some lesser littérateur.
Consequently their attitude was disposed to be hostile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wonderful to relate, Eunice Terry felt no apprehensions.
She was quite certain of herself. She had spent long hours
“getting” her “silly old lines,” and she had “got” them.
True, she thought the part was a “dud and a stuma,” and
she didn’t pretend to understand half the things she had to
say—still, that was the way with Shakespeare, and she had
a “perfect duck of a make-up.” Violet O’Neal had helped
her with it, and never were lily tints and rose more happily
blended. She was as sure of her success as though already
her picture postcards had gone into the hundredth edition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before going on, she approached Mr. Cardomay, sombre
and Semitic as the Merchant, and asked, more for something
to say than from any doubt on the point, “D’you think I
shall be all right?” and he gravely replied, “You will do
everything I expect of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not be fair to follow the performance through its
disastrous stages of incompetence and “dry-up” to the abrupt
and unfinished climax. The Shakespearean Society were
chiefly responsible for the disturbance. From the moment
of Eunice’s first entrance they felt an insult had been placed
upon their intelligence, an insult that called for immediate
reprisals. The Quality of Mercy is all very well, but when
you are told about it by someone who evidently hasn’t the
slightest idea what she is talking about, the most lenient
is apt to change his mercy to a Quality of Justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To borrow a phrase from the parlance of “the road,”
Eunice Terry asked for, and got, “the Bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first she didn’t understand, and floundered on hopelessly
through a quagmire of unbalanced lines. Then, to an
accompaniment of shouts and whistles, the truth dawned on
her, and her little lower lip shot out and began to work spasmodically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing which, Henry Churchill got up and “engaged” the
gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cowards!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Freddie Manning from the prompt corner took advantage
of the tumult to shout:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I ring down, Guv’nor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Eliphalet, but he had to shut his eyes to hide
the grief on the little face before him. “Go on, Miss Terry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t—I’ve forgotten—I don’t want to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rotten!” shouted the house with one accord. “Rotten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eunice burst into tears and rushed from the stage,
and simultaneously Henry Churchill fought his way out of
the stalls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry, ladies and gentlemen,” said Eliphalet
Cardomay, and the curtain fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eunice Terry was crying brokenly against a scene flat, but
he offered her no word of comfort or condolence. He had
seen Henry Churchill’s furious exit from the stalls, and he
hoped he wouldn’t be long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid you have done yourself very little good,
Miss Terry,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’ll never act again!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, at the psychological moment, when all the world
was against her, came Henry Churchill, with a broad shoulder,
to soak up her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for you, sir, to expose her to such—such brutal treatment,”
he exploded over his enveloping arm, “if you were a
younger man, I’d—I’d——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it is, I shall take her away here and now. Yes, and
if you sue us for breach of contract, we shall fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t fight,” said Eliphalet quietly. “Rather live happily
ever afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, dear, put on your things, and I’ll get you out of
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Henry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so anxiously did she obey his instructions that she
took off her stage make-up and forgot to put on the one for
the street. She even forgot the white fox in her haste to be
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through his dressing-room window Eliphalet Cardomay
watched Henry Churchill, still scarlet with indignation, place
Mary Kent in a cab and drive away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have often remarked, Manning,” he said, “one gets
very little thanks for doing things for people.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GETTING THE BEST</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite his remark at the conclusion of the foregoing
chapter it was not Eliphalet Cardomay’s habit to
look for thanks, and on the rare occasions when it was
offered he usually murmured something quite incoherent
and sought to escape. His real lode-star was to obtain a
result, and no amount of personal inconvenience counted in
this most vital of all obligations. To obtain the best result
from the material at hand was practically his religion.
Not as a rule given to boasting, yet he might frequently
be heard to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can always be sure of getting the best from any member
of my company, be it in or out of the theatre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a harmless enough little foible and saved many an
inept actor or actress from reproaches. Eliphalet would argue
that even though the quality of art with which they served
him was indifferent, it represented the high-water mark of
which they were capable, and so he forebore to criticise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like the martyrs of old, Eliphalet lived his ideals and
was ready to uphold them by any sacrifice, as the succeeding
episode goes to demonstrate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No first-class provincial touring company need despise
the Pier Pavilion at Brestwater-super-Mare. It boasts a
stage of bold proportions, a capacious be-mirrored and
luxuriously-upholstered auditorium and a façade that compels
instant admiration. The design, a happy mixture of all
the exhibition buildings which have ever sprung into existence,
combined with a strong vein of Moorish architecture,
is a triumph of skill and ingenuity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, indeed, may the happy manager who has been
fortunate enough to book a week there swell with pride
as he passes the turnstile of the Pier, without the prepayment
of twopence, and sees the majestic domes and spires
of the Pavilion whitely silhouette themselves against the
turquoise Channel waters. In such inspired surroundings,
with the chuckle of sea beneath his feet, and the singing
of the wind in his ears, who could choose but feel carefree
and joyous, and give both-handedly of his artistic best?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet Cardomay, one of the mildest creatures
God ever placed upon earth—a man of most even temper
and lovable qualities—sensitive to an extreme of the influences
of his environments—was in a dark and forbidding
mood. The beauty of the day, the music of the water,
the rococo architecture, were as nothing to him. With
hands clasped behind his back, stickless and hatless, he
strode the pier boards like a man possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importunities of peroxided young ladies who, from
the vantage of their little kiosks, besought him to buy
chocolates, local views, frozen roses—or to solve the mystery
of a certain walking-stick which in adept hands
would transform itself into a useless pen—he almost rudely
ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phtsss!” he exploded aloud. “The man’s a coward—an
incompetent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gripped the railings of the Pier and gazed fiercely
out to sea, while the wind played cornfields in his long
grey hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A photographer, ever alert for fresh victims, approached
and commenting upon the favourable condition of the elements,
suggested that the gentleman might feel disposed
to have a “likeness” taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not feel disposed,” returned Eliphalet, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some most amusing backgrounds,” continued the
photographer, in no wise rebuffed, and proceeded, to describe
how, in his professional opinion, Eliphalet would
prove a suitable subject to place his head through a hole
in a large canvas upon which was painted an astonishingly-clad
individual riding on a rocking-horse. He wound up
with the words, “Causes roars of laughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet spun round and fixed two pin-points upon his
frock-coated persecutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you seeking to amuse yourself at my expense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir—I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the photographer was not a man to be trifled with.
His hand flew to his hip pocket, in the manner of a mining-camp
desperado, and withdrew a neat fan of samples of his
craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure,” he blandly ventured, “after a glance through
these, I should number you among my patrons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a view to scattering the photographer’s examples
upon the waves, Eliphalet Cardomay snatched them from
the extended hand; but before he had accomplished his
intention he abruptly checked himself. The top photograph
had caught his eye. It depicted a knock-kneed individual
dressed in a close-fitting striped garment, shivering
upon the steps of a bathing-machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” exclaimed Eliphalet, surveying the image at the
length of his arm. “Ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most amusing, is it not?” volunteered the photographic
artist, with an accompanying smile usually employed as
a pattern for his more serious sitters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet regarded him with one eyebrow raised high
above its fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amusing! Appropriate, if you like, but amusing—no—it
is contemptible.” And so saying, he slapped the photographs
into the astonished artist’s hand and, throwing
back his head, stalked off, past the line of melancholy fishers
in the direction of his dressing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the stripped stage were assembled the various
members of his company; for the most part they had composed
themselves in little groups and were talking in animated
whispers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the medley of subdued tongues occasional fragments
of speech were audible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But these juveniles are not like they were in our day,
Kitterson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could see Mr. Cardomay was in a rage,” said
Violet O’Neal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have sworn if he hadn’t gone out,” returned Miss
Fullar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t think what Cartwright’s making such a fuss over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any fool could jump six feet into a net.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish they’d give me the part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t get away from it, old man, Cartwright’s no
actor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his back against the proscenium and fiddling with
an unlighted cigarette, stood an isolated figure, over whom
seemed to hover a spirit of tragedy. Ever and anon his
eyes sought a wooden structure at the back of the stage.
The structure was in the nature of a rostrum, about ten
feet in height, beneath which was stretched a substantial
net some thirty inches clear of the boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This young man was Mr. Aloysius Cartwright, the new
<span class='it'>jeune premier</span> for the forthcoming production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up and down before him, his bowler hat eclipsing his
right eye and the major portion of the right side of his
face, walked Mr. Manning, the stage-manager. Presently
he halted in his stride and addressed Mr. Cartwright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, why don’t you have another packet at it
while the Guv’nor’s away? Make up your mind to do it,
and it’s as good as done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, really, Manning, I’ve—I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Manning sniffed noisily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes to this, o’ man. You’ll put the kibosh on the
whole show if you don’t. I can’t see what you’re raising
the wind over. You told me you were a swimmer, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can swim a bit, but that has nothing to do with
it. What I——” He stopped, for at that moment Eliphalet
Cardomay appeared through the swing-doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His entrance caused something of a nervous flutter, for
everyone had felt the effects of the rehearsal which had
ended in his abrupt departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wrath of a naturally quiet-humoured man is always
somewhat alarming, for no one can be sure of the direction
in which it will vent itself. But apparently the thunder-clouds
had passed away, for when Eliphalet came to a
halt in the glare of the bunch light, his features were
almost seraphic in their calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Manning,” he said. “We will go on, ladies and
gentlemen, please. Mr. Cartwright, I apologise for my
hasty departure a while ago, but you—well, I was upset.
It is a matter of personal pride with me that I have always—and
in using the word I speak advisedly—have always
been able to get the best out of any actor or actress I have
employed. For a moment I feared that you—that I was to
sacrifice that reputation; and I am sure, Mr. Cartwright,
you would not willingly cause me so much distress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I——” began Aloysius Cartwright—but the senior
man held up his hand in a gesture compelling silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you have not fully realised the essence of the
scene and what I have here may help you to do so.” So
saying, he unrolled a large sheet of paper he had been carrying
and displayed a very lurid poster of a young man in
evening dress leaping from a lock-gate into a canal. It was
a striking composition in which black shadows and a much-reflected
moon played important parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Cartwright, with this as your guide I am
certain I shall not appeal to you in vain.” And Eliphalet
Cardomay, having made the <span class='it'>amende honorable</span> for his previous
ill-humour, smiled a kindly smile of encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Aloysius Cartwright failed to seize the opportunity
of reinstating himself in his manager’s good graces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It—it is all very well, sir, but I wish to say that I am
neither an acrobat nor a cinema actor—my tastes are for—for
legitimate work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines about Eliphalet’s mouth drew down and hardened.
“I think,” he said, “you are confusing the issue.
The question appears to me to turn more upon personal
valour than upon anything else.” Then, speaking with
sudden enthusiasm, “Why, my dear, dear boy—consider a
moment. Put yourself in the hero’s position. Imagine your
own sweetheart bound hand and foot and struggling in the
waters of the canal. Would you hesitate for a second?
No. Would you falter before the task of saving her from
the clutches of the stream? No, no. Then be the man
whom you’re portraying. Play upon the impulsiveness of
your nature, the gallantry of your youth, the pluck—the
enthusiasm—the <span class='it'>élan</span>: lift up—grip us—thrill us, and——”
with an abrupt change from the inspired to the finite, “do
remember that we’re producing the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try,” said Mr. Cartwright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear the stage,” shouted Manning, clapping his hands
to support the order. “Up left, Miss Maybank, please.
Come on, Fieldfare—for goodness’ sake, o’ man. Now
where’s that rope? Props! PROPS!!” An old man wearing
a green baize apron thrust his head through the opening
to the scene dock. “Get that rope—quick—and try
and remember some of us live by eating, and don’t want
to be here all day. There you are! Catch hold, Denton!
Where’ll they start, Guv’nor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss O’Neal’s entrance. I’ll go into the stalls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your entrance, my dear. Ready, sir? Right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Violet O’Neal the <span class='it'>ingénue</span>, stepped out from behind an
imaginary wing and began to walk between two chalked
lines on the stage, indicating the bank of the river on one
hand, and the ancient mill on the other. In the excitement
of the moment she overstepped the margins of the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t do that,” said Eliphalet, rising from his seat. “It
is not the intention you should fall in the water before
being thrown there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back, please,” from Manning. “Once more, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Violet retraced her steps and came on again with the
nervous air of an amateur walking the tightrope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet tapped with his stick on the brass rail of the
orchestra pit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little more natural grace, please,” he suggested. “And
shouldn’t you be singing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite—but please don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Manning, “Once more, please!” And a glance
at his watch, for the stage-manager was a person who
took lunch seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time she succeeded better with the manœuvre and
produced a humming sound intended to indicate a carefree
damsel enjoying the evening air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from the assumed shadow of the mill leapt two
figures and barred her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Jasper—you!” cried the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” corrected Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I,” amended Fieldfare. “You little counted on the
pleasure of renewing our acquaintance so soon—eh?” (Sinister
words with a hint of dark deeds behind them.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please let me pass.” This imperiously from the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass! There is but one passing for you, and that lies
there.” With a gesture towards where the water would be
on the night. “Unless——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a child to be frightened by such threats, Sir
Jasper. Stand aside, or I shall cry for help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cry, will you?—and who will answer it? The trees—the
hills—the river?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cartwright placed his foot in the lowest rung of the
ladder leading to the rostrum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Maybank: “I command you to let me pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fieldfare: “You little fool! Don’t you realise that at
this moment you are utterly mine?—that I could flick
out your life as easily as—er—” he fluffed for his words,
“as easily as I could crack a nut in a door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you talking about?” interrupted Eliphalet.
“Beneath my heel is the line. Persons of quality do not
crack nuts in doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fieldfare: “Crack a nut beneath my heels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“HEEL—singular. It is not a cocoanut that requires
both feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beneath my heel,” pursued Fieldfare with a nervousness
which reflected itself in Mr. Aloysius Cartwright’s lick-lipping,
collar-in-finger perturbation. “Choose, and choose
quickly—life with me, or death, and death alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like lightning she whisked round to make good, but
the second man was upon her, and bound her wrists with
cruel dexterity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frank—Frank!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fieldfare: “Little fool! by now your Frank is in the
arms of the Duchess of Cleeve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the truth. So make up your mind quickly—your
lover is false to you—which shall it be—life or death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If life means life with you—then death a hundred
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fieldfare: “Well, die, then—die!” And with a coward’s
blow he pushed her over the river-bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prompter: “Splash! Two handfuls of rice, and that’s
your cue light, Mr. Cartwright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment it seemed that the panic had deserted
Aloysius, for he clattered up the steps three at a time,
crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doris! Doris! Where are you? Doris, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fieldfare: “H’st! Quickly away!” And he and his
companion flitted into the shadows as Cartwright, like a
human whirlwind, dashed on to the lock bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a man distraught, he gripped the bridge rail and
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you, my love? Where are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the water below came a faint cry of:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fraaank! Fr—a—!” gugle—gugle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cartwright: “My God!—in the river—drowning! I—I
am coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay leaned forward tensely in his stall,
as with superb abandon the hero whipped off his dress coat
and, casting it from him, sprang on to the rail of the
bridge. With hands high above his head—posed for a
magnificent dive—he stood there for one breathless second—then
suddenly his body went all limp, his hands fell
to his sides, and he faltered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use—I can’t do it, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eliphalet Cardomay, for the first time on record,
swore before his entire company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damnation!” The word rang out like a tocsin. Then,
tearing off his hat, he kicked it across the auditorium and
high up into the dress-circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lamentable creature!” he cried. “Wretched poltroon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cartwright slowly descended from the rostrum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not part of my professional ambition to leap into
a net,” he faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leap!” echoed Eliphalet wildly. “Leap! Dare you
employ such a word? I have seen a tile fall from a roof
with more grace. I have seen a blind man stumble on a
banana-skin with greater dignity. But a more pitiable
craven-hearted exhibition than yours I—I——” Words
failed him. “You have ruined my belief in the younger
generation—you have shattered my belief in myself. Manning,
Manning! what are we going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a bit of lunch, Guv’nor, and talk it over quietly
afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So attractive did the proposition sound that without
awaiting the sanction of the master, the entire company
trooped to the wings and, grabbing their hats and coats,
made for the nearest exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before in the recollection of the oldest member
of the company had “the Guv’nor” given way to the slightest
exhibition of temper, and the occasion had seriously
unnerved them. That he should have lost control of himself
to the extent of using violent language, and kicking
his defenceless hat, was a revelation which could only be
conversationally approached in the fresh air and sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some form of belated courage induced Mr. Cartwright to
remain, after the others had departed, brushing his Homburg
hat upon his sleeve and buttoning and unbuttoning
his gloves. He of all others had the greater reason for
flight, and to his credit be it entered that he lingered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet Cardomay was in no mood to spare him
on that account. Like a destroyer circling a troop-ship,
he revolved round the unhappy Aloysius, ever and anon
firing salvoes of reproach and opprobrium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when, unable to endure longer the whips and scorns
of the managerial tongue, Mr. Cartwright sought to escape,
Eliphalet was close upon his heels, jerking out verbal
grenades of the most poignant nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Past the lines of melancholy fishers they pursued their
way, hunted and hunter; through the turnstile of what
might be called the super-pier upon which the Pavilion
was situated, they made their way—Mr. Cartwright doing
his best to preserve an air of stoic endurance, and Eliphalet
Cardomay following with periodical explosions of
artistic wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the box-office, the lurid poster of the hero leaping
into the canal insisted upon recognition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” cried Eliphalet, restraining his quarry with the
crook of his stick. “Look, and be ashamed! That is
what I have led the public to expect, and——” His eye
fell upon the photographer’s booth, not five yards distant,
beside which sat a young lady, tilting back her chair against
the chain bulwarks of the pier. “HA! It is not too late
to make amends. I have never yet cheated my public.
Come!” And seizing the youth by the arm, he dragged
him protestingly towards the temple of photographic art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The photographer was seated within, indulging his appetite
with a cut from the joint and two vegetables imported
from a neighbouring café. He rose, politely masticating,
as the two came in, and inquired, to the best ability of
his well-filled mouth, in what manner he could be of service
to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have brought you a subject,” said Eliphalet. “I
wish you to take this gentleman with his head thrust
through the hole of that vile canvas of the shivering creature
on the bathing-machine steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I protest,” began Cartwright, but Eliphalet talked him
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall want it enlarged to the size of the poster yonder,
which it is destined to supplant. I shall placard it on
every hoarding in the town. I shall——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the sentence was never completed, for from immediately
outside came a sharp, wild scream. Through the
windows of the studio they had a momentary glimpse of
a pair of white shoes and stockings pointing towards
Heaven for a fraction of time. Followed another shriller
scream and a deep, resonant splash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good ’eavens!” cried the photographer, rendered aitch-less
by surprise. “That girl’s fallen in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By common consent they rushed out, and were confronted
with a view of an upturned chair, a swinging chain,
and in the water below, the flash of a white skirt and an
outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s drowning!” gasped Eliphalet, in genuine horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then spoke Aloysius Cartwright, and his words tumbled
over one another like the waters of a cataract:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a chance, sir—a chance! You—you’ve slanged
and vilified me all the morning for making a muddle of
the rescue scene. Here’s the real thing! Here’s a chance
to show me how to do it now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The walking-stick fell from Eliphalet’s hand and a fine
colour flushed his cheek, as he said, articulating each word
with biting emphasis:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sixty-two years of age, Mr. Cartwright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Cartwright, his temper roused by much pricking,
was beyond the touch of sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I merely said it was a chance,” he replied. “I didn’t
expect you would take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man’s face went very white, and with trembling
fingers he released the buttons of his long coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not?” he said. “I have never asked a man
to perform what I lacked the courage to do myself, Mr.
Cartwright, so kindly observe me.” And, throwing aside
his coat, he sprang head-first into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” exclaimed Cartwright, and fell back a
pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, by this time a crowd had assembled. With the
light of hope in their eyes, and greatly to the confusion
of their lines, the melancholy fishermen came hurrying to
the spot. The various sweet and novelty shops swiftly
gave up their complement of be-pearled, peroxided maidens.
A very worldly-wise young man, in a blue suit,
which seemed to be entering into a colour competition with
the sea, on the not unnatural assumption that a cinema
play was in course of production, asked his friend where
the camera was situated. From the far side of the pier a
boatman, whose duty it was to guard the destinies of bathers,
aroused himself from lethargy and plied a busy oar
among the pier-piles, beneath the spectators, towards the
confusion in the water. An old lady in a bath-chair, who,
that very morning, had confided to her fellow-guests at the
boarding-house her utter inability to walk unaided, alighted
from her conveyance with surprising alacrity and managed
to secure a place in the front row, while, in token of the
mistake of leaping rapidly to conclusions, from the back
of the crowd came a querulous and oft-repeated cry of
“Fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make a passage there,” shouted a compelling voice, and
shouldering his way through the crowd came Mr. Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing Cartwright, he demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell’s up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Guv’nor! A girl fell into the sea, and—and he—he
went in after her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! But he can’t swim, man—he’ll drown!” And
gripping the pier railings, Mr. Manning leant perilously
over the side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean that,” gasped Cartwright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean it! Look for yourself, you fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Cartwright looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young lady on whose behalf Mr. Cardomay had
committed himself to the deep had already disappeared.
A kindly wave had washed her to within easy grasp of an
iron cross-tie, where, gripping tenaciously, she moved in
rhythmic sympathy to the motions of the channel tide.
But the case of Eliphalet was none so good. Neither was
Rome built, nor are divers made, in a day. Eliphalet had
landed (to use a contradiction in terms) full-length and flat
upon the waters, and as a result suffered the loss of every
vestige of wind his lungs contained. Wherefore the process
of drowning was but a matter of moments. Already he had
made one of his allotted three excursions among the laminaria
of the ocean bed, and the second was in active
course of preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Guv’nor!” wailed Mr. Manning. “You can’t swim,
and neither can I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the unexpected came to pass. Mr. Aloysius
Cartwright—one-time coward and craven—of a sudden
became a hero and a man. Disregarding the sensibilities
of the feminine element in the crowd, he peeled off his
coat and vest, kicked his beautiful brogue shoes right and
left (incidentally breaking one of the photographer’s windows),
and performed a dive so faultless in its athletic perfection
as to excite a cry of rapture and amazement from
all present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He “took off” at the precise moment Eliphalet came to
the surface for the second time, and it was only by a miracle
he failed to torpedo that unhappy man or alight head-first
in the prow of the boat which had unexpectedly shot
out from beneath the pier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is certain and beyond dispute that had he delayed
another second he would have broken his own neck, sunk
the boat and driven Eliphalet finally to the bottom. But
the tragedy was averted, and he cleft the waves with scarce
a bubble to mark his entry. Reappearing with a strong
side-stroke some twenty feet away, he made for the boat,
where his assistance was instrumental in considerably delaying
the work of rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sorry-looking and draggle-tailed trio who eventually
came to port at the little iron stairway by the pier-head.
Between them Cartwright and Mr. Manning conveyed
Eliphalet Cardomay to a couch in his dressing-room.
The young lady who caused these sensational happenings
was carried off by one of the peroxide sisterhood, and
departs from our field of vision in a semi-hysterical condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mr. Manning who took entire charge of the work
of bringing “the Guv’nor” round, and did it with that
thoroughness which distinguished all his undertakings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eventually Eliphalet opened his eyes and let them drift
round the room until they came to rest on Aloysius Cartwright,
who was forming an island in an ocean that dripped
from his clothes. Eliphalet regarded him with a puzzled
expression which suddenly cleared and was supplanted by
a rare and almost beautiful smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a wonderful dive, Mr. Cartwright,” he murmured.
“Just what I wanted.” The smile transformed
itself into a look of great contentment. “I have always
believed I could bring out the best in any member of my
company. I think I am justified in holding that opinion
still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is an advertising age, and the success of a commodity
depends not so much on its quality as the quality
of the advertisement bringing it before the public eye.
Nevertheless, and despite the packed houses which patronised
his new production, Eliphalet Cardomay was highly
incensed when asked by a reporter to confide to the columns
of the <span class='it'>Brestwater Mercury</span> the precise sum he had
paid in gold to the young lady who fell into the sea.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>QUICKSANDS OF TRADITION</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>People who imagine an actor’s life is all honey forget
that he has to read plays, and the reading of plays is
at once the most onerous and exacting of all tasks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not one in a hundred is fit to be read, and scarcely one
in a thousand deserves production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly everyone believes he can write a play, and most
of these believers have a shot at it—and good, bad or indifferent,
each one of these shots is stuffed into the barrel
of a quarto envelope, charged with the address of this or
that theatrical manager, and propelled by means of a given
number of postage-stamps to its billet upon the managerial
desk. Should the desk pertain to one of the more illustrious
lights of the stage, the envelope is carried off by some
erudite young gentleman, employed for the purpose, who
cons the manuscript by the light of midnight oil, and
directs its future career forward or backward, as the merit
of the work suggests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of this melancholy vocation the optic nerves
and digestive organs invariably become impaired. The
reader loses interest in life and sense of appreciation. He
becomes a confirmed cynic and usually blights his own
career by throwing out an obvious winner, and being
thrown out himself for so doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But those who work upon the Road, who have no swing-door
offices in the Haymarket or Shaftesbury Avenue, who
travel year in and year out dragging their productions from
one town to another, who live in cheap hotels or cheaper
lodgings, who have neither house nor home nor any household
goods to call their own—naught save a succession of
ugly theatrical baskets—for these no such luxury as a
reader of plays exists. It is part of the price they must
pay for billing their names so wide and large on the provincial
hoardings that all odd hours and the pleasant magazine-time
of the Sunday train journey should be spent in
the consideration of unsought-for dramatic effusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could compete with Eliphalet Cardomay’s energy
in this direction. He had made a strict rule to read two
plays on week-days and three on Sundays, and he never
departed from it. Yet, despite his diligent inquiry into the
realms, or rather, reams, of the unknown, never once, in
thirty years of provincial management, did he discover
and produce a new play. He just went on doing the old
repertory routine of revival and re-revival, and then back
again to the beginning. Sometimes he would vary the
order by purchasing the touring rights of a successful
London melodrama, but these ventures were few and far
between. Yet always at the back of his head was the belief
that one day he would chance upon and present an
entirely original and unexploited work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at a time when he was debating on the advisability
of making an offer for the latest Lyceum success that
a copy of “A Man’s Way” came to hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started to examine it on a journey between Glasgow
and Brighton, and before arriving at his journey’s
end he had read it three times, and his stage-manager,
Freddie Manning, had read it twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think, Manning?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not too bad,” replied Manning, who was not given to
superlatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good title, ‘A Man’s Way’—an arresting title.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might be worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And an ingenious plot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M’m!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something very original about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wants a lot of cutting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damsite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Mr. Theodore Leonard—ever heard of him, Manning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage-manager picked his teeth negatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, neither have I. A first play, probably. Very
fresh and ingenious—modern, too. Yes, yes! The part
of the doctor—with a little alteration—I think we could
get away with it. H’m! read it again, Manning—read it
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of Manning’s second excursion through “A
Man’s Way” was reassuring. He repeated his former verdict
that it “wasn’t too bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night as he lay in bed Eliphalet Cardomay digested
“A Man’s Way” and revolved the possibilities of doing it
in his mind. It was so essentially unlike anything he had
ever done before that the prospect pleased. The central
character of the doctor was his firm, purposeful way—his
manner of treating wife and patient with the same unvarying
but just dictatorship—it was new, and yet true to life—very
human, if only on account of the unemotional quality
of the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From beginning to end there wasn’t a single set speech—no
lofty periods of crescendo to induce those rapturous
outbursts of applause by means of which members of
provincial audiences seek to convince their immediate
neighbours that they are sensible and appreciative to the
influences of uplifting thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To produce such a work would be a step up. It would
present him as an actor in a new light. He would encourage
a deeper-thinking public. He would, <span class='it'>ipso facto</span>, become
a modern. Modern influences were afoot on the stage
nowadays, and he, Eliphalet, still floundered in the dead
seas of rodomontade. Why should he live in the past,
when here was “A Man’s Way” to lead him to the future?
Eliphalet sat up in bed and lit the candle. Somewhere in
the second act were some lines that struck the key-note of
what was and what had been. They arose from where a
poor, half-starved penitent came with a piteous tale to tell,
and he, the doctor, made answer, “It’ll keep, won’t it? Get
some grub and a good sleep. We’ll fix the rest in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet suddenly remembered a play he had done years
and years before, in which a somewhat similar scene occurred,
in which he had said, “Not to-night, my brother.
Your body needs nourishment, your brain needs rest. Go—take
what my poor dwelling has to offer. Eat, sleep, and
pray to Him to visit your dreams with peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably for the first time in his life it dawned on Eliphalet
Cardomay that this kind of talk was bosh—stilted
bosh. People didn’t say things like that; wherefore it
was sheer dishonesty to proclaim such stuff to an audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have done with this nonsense—he would rise
superior to these absurd stage conventions, and for the
future devote himself solely to reproducing the actualities
of life and the actualities of speech. And having arrived
at this sensational resolve, Eliphalet rose, donned a dressing-gown
and seating himself at the little davenport desk
by the window, drew pen and paper towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally and absolutely he had made up his mind he
would “do” “A Man’s Way,” and then and there he wrote
to Mr. Theodore Lennard and said that, though his work
had made a distinctly favourable impression, he could see
no prospects immediate or otherwise of producing the play.
Nevertheless it might be to their mutual advantage to
meet and discuss the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This done, he paddled across the moonlit street in gown
and carpet slippers, and dropped the letter into the pillar-box
at the corner, and it was not until he heard it fluttering
down against the iron sides of its cage that the first
doubt assailed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a gentle night and warm. Fifty yards away the
iron railings of the esplanade traced black lines across
the luminous sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet forgot his unconventional attire, and a few
moments later was leaning over the railings, listening to
the swish and rustle of the pebbles as the water washed
them to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same old sea,” he thought, “just the same as ever—unchangeable—from
Christ’s time to mine.” Then
aloud, and with startling emphasis, “Get some grub and a
good sleep—we can fix the rest in the morning. I don’t
know,” said Eliphalet, “really I don’t know. ‘Eat, sleep
and pray to Him to visit your dreams with peace.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Realism and Art—if it were Art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For thirty years it had passed for Art with him—thirty
unchangeable years. Did reality for the stage actually
exist, or was it a mere modern fetish? Change—Futurism—Realism!
What were they but ugly likenesses of nature—the
human frame with all its bones showing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was a fairy over the sea, and the sea a playground
for the moods of light—unchangeable, unreal, as it
was in the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no realism,” mused Eliphalet. “It plays no
part in our spiritual lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a rubber-soled policeman came down the esplanade,
and spoke harsh words regarding folk who walked
the night in carpet-slippers and dressing-gowns. He instanced
cases where heavy penalties had been awarded for
lesser offences, and followed Eliphalet to his lodging with
flashing bull’s-eye and threatening mien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes—yes,” said Eliphalet testily. “Very sorry,
and if you are not satisfied, come round and we’ll fix things
up in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slightly distressed, he returned to bed. It was surprising
he should have used the word “fix.” Curious how one
adapts oneself to a change—even of vocabulary. “A Man’s
Way” was certainly a fine play—realistic—human!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Theodore Lennard lived at Worthing and duly received
the letter on the following morning. A young man
was Mr. Lennard, shy and retiring to a fault but gifted
with strong faculties for literary force. He could make his
characters express themselves most vigorously—in fact, say
things which he himself, under similar stresses of emotion,
would never dare to utter. He wrote easily, frankly and
honestly, and he loved his characters and envied them their
vigour and lovable qualities. It was pitiful to reflect that
he, with his knowledge of how a strong man should act,
should be as pliable as a reed in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond question the world should have known the works
of Theodore Lennard long before this story was written,
and the reason why he was still obscure was because never
before had he had the courage to submit any of his writings
for approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was his first experiment, and lo, within three days
of posting it, came a letter from an established stage personality
expressive of admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennard read and re-read Eliphalet Cardomay’s non-committal
communication, and his elation knew no bounds.
He felt he had been discovered—a stupendous feeling.
America must have been conscious of it when Christopher
Columbus hove over her horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour and a half later, not without misgivings, he
presented himself at the stage-door of the Theatre Royal,
Brighton. Mr. Cardomay, he was informed, was not within—he
was probably lunching at his lodging. A request
for the address of the lodging was sternly refused. It
is an unwritten law that stage-doors never give addresses,
however inconvenient the withholding of them may prove.
He would do well, the doorkeeper advised, to call again
that evening after the performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prospect of spending several hours on the esplanade
somewhat depressed Mr. Lennard, but he was rescued from
such an unpleasant necessity by the opportune arrival of
Freddie Manning, who thrust a long arm through the little
window of the doorkeeper’s box and seized a handful of
miscellaneous correspondence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Realising he was in the presence of a man of importance,
Mr. Theodore Lennard coughed discreetly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Manning, shuffling the letters from one hand
to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—Good morning—afternoon—my name is—or rather,
I was hoping to see Mr. Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennard stuttered, and after a period of incoherence
produced Eliphalet’s note and handed it to the stage-manager,
who read it through and frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” he said. “Well, the Guv’nor’s busy at the moment.
He’s—er—working on a play we shall probably be
producing.” (This was pure fiction, or, as Manning would
have said, a business stroke.) “If you come round to 15
St. James’s Place at 4.30, I’ll try to get you a hearing.
Morning.” And tilting his hat well over his right eye,
Manning hurried off in the direction of his master’s abode.
He found Eliphalet at lunch, and started abruptly with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this business about Theodore Lennard, Guv’nor?
You’re never seriously thinking of doing that play
of his—are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet consumed a mouthful of Bartlett Pear anointed
with Bird’s Custard before replying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I wrote to him last night I firmly intended to
do so—but this morning I am a little undecided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The author’s turned up, and he’s coming along here at
4.30.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me! Is he indeed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’d better prepare a choke-off right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet mused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I choke him off, Manning? You said
yourself it was a good play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said it wasn’t too bad,” corrected Manning exactly.
“Besides, I thought you’d fixed on the Lyceum piece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is exactly like every other drama we have ever
produced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’re exactly like all the other characters we’ve
ever played. No good changing our play if we can’t change
ourselves to match it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet looked sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why can’t we change ourselves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Manning quoted briefly the proverb of the
leopard and the Ethiopian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not very charitable this morning, Manning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a business talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if we ourselves are immutable we must change
the substance of the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or cut it out and do the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ‘A Man’s Way’ is so original,” came from Eliphalet,
with a plaintive note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie stuck his hands deep into his pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Granted,” he began, “but it don’t fit us. It don’t fit
us anywhere. Look at the leading part—a smart Harley
Street surgeon! Ever seen a Harley Street surgeon, Guv’nor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I could go to Harley Street, and for two guineas——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ’ud cost you more than that before you’d done.
Why, Guv’nor, you’d have to turn yourself inside out. You
couldn’t wear the clothes—and you couldn’t play the part
in the clothes you do wear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old actor’s hand sought his flowing tie with an affectionate
touch. “There’s something in what you say,
Manning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot in it. Bar a parson or a Silver King fixture,
you’re not the type for modern parts. Then, again—would
you cut your hair short? Not you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Eliphalet. “Such as I am I have always been.
I should certainly decline to transfigure myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are, then! Stick to the old stuff, I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have a yearning for the new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the boss,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to do this play, Manning—very much indeed.”
Suddenly he rose dramatically. “Manning!” he exclaimed.
“If I am unsuited to the rôle of a Doctor of Medicine, why
not alter him to a Doctor of Divinity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean changing the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why not, and what of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how about the ‘Pauline’?” said Manning, opening
a fresh field of opposition. “None of our girls ’ud do,
and they’re all on long contracts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Morries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tss! She’s <span class='it'>ingénue</span>—Sweet Nancy—sun-bonnet and
long strings. She’d never get away with that cold-storage
class of goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet drew patterns on the table-cloth with a long
sensitive forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It should not be difficult,” he hazarded, “to alter her
part as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the author consents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a point we can decide at half-past four. Please
don’t throw any more cold water on the scheme. I am
really anxious to be associated with modern thought, and
this forceful young man has shown me the way—‘A Man’s
Way.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At precisely four-twenty-nine the forceful young man in
question was ringing the bell of Number 15, St. James’s
Place, and as the skeleton clock on the half-landing proclaimed
the half-hour he was ushered into Mr. Cardomay’s
august presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Eliphalet expected to see in Mr. Lennard a pattern
of masculine virility he was grievously mistaken. Nothing
could have been more ineffective or retiring than the young
man’s demeanour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So strange is the working of the human mind that this
outward display of weakness at once affected Eliphalet’s
appreciation of “A Man’s Way.” He felt that it was impossible
that originality and power could flow from such
a source. Subconsciously he was offended that that high,
narrow forehead and the thin, nervous hands before him
could have produced in literature such vigorous characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while these thoughts were passing through his brain
Mr. Theodore Lennard stuttered out his apologies and
excuses for intruding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Eliphalet. “I am very pleased to see
you. Sit down, and we will have some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until tea had come and gone that the subject
of the play was broached. Freddie Manning was the
one to introduce it, and he did so as though it were of
secondary interest to a tooth he was picking with the
whisker of a recently-devoured prawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure,” echoed Eliphalet. “The play! Well, Mr.
Lennard, we have read it and, with certain reservations, we
like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think it not too bad,” amended Manning, who had
broken the prawn’s whisker at a critical point of leverage
and was naturally put out about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennard smiled from one to the other to show his
willingness to accept praise or censure with equal avidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Granted certain minor alterations,” pursued Eliphalet,
“we might even be prepared to put the piece into rehearsal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s most awfully good of you. Very, very kind indeed,”
bleated Mr. Lennard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine this is your first play,” and scarcely waiting
for the nod of affirmation, Eliphalet went on, “and that
being so, you understand the—er—remuneration would not
be large—would, in fact, be—er—small.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sort of honorarium,” put in Manning, “You’d get a
royalty or a sum down for all rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whichever you prefer,” interposed Mr. Lennard hastily,
although not half-an-hour earlier he had resolved under no
circumstances to sell out his interests in the play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is of course difficult to get a first play produced at
all,” said Eliphalet, “and the thirty or forty pounds expended
may well prove money thrown away for the manager.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that—I quite see that.” (He had fixed his lowest
price at one hundred down and 20 per cent. royalty,
but such is the elasticity of the artistic mind that these
barriers were instantly swept away.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” said Manning. “Then, taking for granted you
carry out the alterations satisfactorily, you are ready to
take £30 to cover all claims?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talented author hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr.—er—Cardomay mentioned forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Figure of speech, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Manning, I think we might say forty. The
extra ten payable if the play is a success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not business, Guv’nor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s an agreeable suggestion,” said Mr. Lennard,
who was poor as well as honest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a more agreeable suggestion if you paid
back the thirty if the play’s a failure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning’s arguments were too much to cope with, so
the author subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far so good,” said Eliphalet, and produced the manuscript
of the play. “Now, what I chiefly want you to do
in these alterations is to retain the present spirit of the
play as exactly as possible. It is admirably suited to the
title, and the title pleases me greatly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennard looked grateful and asked what was required
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To begin with, the character of the doctor must be
changed to that of a clergyman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A clergyman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. I don’t play doctors, but I can and do play
clergymen. After all, in a healer of the body or a healer
of the mind there is no great difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Lennard nervously, “it’s rather—I
mean—a tall order. Aren’t some of the lines and—er-situations
slightly unsuited to a cleric?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Change ’em, then. Make ’em suitable. That’s an
author’s job, ain’t it?” demanded Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I made a particular study of a Harley Street surgeon
in the character of Dr. Wentall—a most careful study,
in detail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, go round to the Vicarage and make a fresh study
there. You’ve got a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, again, the whole scheme of the play would be
affected. There would be insuperable difficulties in getting
my characters on and off the stage. As patients visiting
a doctor their comings and goings are in perfectly
natural sequence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can fix that all right.” Manning dismissed such
a trivial objection with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Eliphalet pleasantly, “about the part
of the wife, Pauline?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t alter her? I—I thought she was rather
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Admitted. But as it happens we have a young lady
in our present company who, although charming, is scarcely
capable of realising your intentions in this part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wouldn’t it be better to engage someone who was
capable?” suggested Lennard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be rather shirking a responsibility, when
it would be easy for you to modify and simplify the emotions
she would be asked to portray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, then,” Manning explained. “Cut out all
that highly-strung, neurotic bosh and make her a simple,
loving creature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it! With a vein of sunshiny humour.” And
Eliphalet leant back and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how am I to adjust the quick, ill-considered actions
of Pauline, as I’ve conceived her, to the type of character
you suggest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is for you to decide, Mr. Lennard. We are here
simply to reproduce your thoughts—not to inspire them.
All I ask is that you should retain the present spirit of
the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor author looked utterly bewildered, but before
he had recovered his powers of speech in came Manning
with a bombshell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he detonated, “comes the question of Comic
Relief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Eliphalet. “I had quite forgotten the Comic
Relief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theodore Lennard essayed an epigram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seldom found it comic,” he said, “and never a
relief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both his hearers frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must not consider only ourselves in these matters,”
said Eliphalet gravely. “A large percentage of the audience
rely for their pleasure exclusively upon this branch
of the entertainment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t see how I’m to get it in with the people as
I’ve written them, Mr. Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then write some more—we have quite a large company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet fixed his eyes on the ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good deal of harmless fun,” he said, “can be extracted
from highly-characterised domestic servants of opposite
sexes. Their mispronunciation of words, their little
<span class='it'>amours</span>, and perhaps some good-natured horseplay among
the chairs and tables.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you serious, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am seriously suggesting a vein of humour. And now,
Mr. Lennard, if you will consider these minor alterations,
I trust we shall come to an arrangement satisfactory to you
and to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lennard rose and fumbled with his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’ll do what I can,” he said. Then, with unexpected
courage, “But how would it be if you produced the play
as it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, that’s hardly playing the game, o’ man,”
said Manning. “You waste an hour of the Guv’nor’s time,
and then put up a suggestion like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes—I see. I beg your pardon, Mr. Cardomay.
I apologise. Good afternoon, and thank you very, very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After ten days the second version of “A Man’s Way”
was delivered, and Eliphalet started to read it in great
excitement. When he had finished, he was possessed with
the curious conviction that he was mad. Accordingly he
sent for Manning, and fluttered round while the stage-manager
snorted through the manuscript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Manning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all wrong. Parsons don’t act like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet nodded. “And they don’t talk like that,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning whisked over some pages. “Look at this bit,
Guv’nor. ‘Get some grub and a good sleep.’ ” (Odd he
should have chosen that line.) “People wouldn’t stick it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes—absurd! He should be soothing—inspired!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, again, this stage direction: ‘Takes Pauline by
the shoulders and pushes her through the French window
into the night, saying, “As you can’t be mentally cauterised,
you’d better be mentally cooled.” ’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shocking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d throw things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, curiously enough, in the first version I thought
that scene was good. He has made a mistake in keeping
that hard note in the character. Besides, now that the
Pauline has been sweetened, there is no longer any occasion
for such drastic measures. And the Comic Relief,
Manning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrible, Guv’nor. Out of place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt the same. Send Lennard a wire, Manning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saying it’s all off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—but I want to talk to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way to the Post Office, Manning almost ran into
Theodore Lennard, who had followed in the wake of his
play. The stage-manager buttonholed him at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve fairly done it,” he opened fire. “Your play’s
like a bit of bad joinery where the joints don’t fit, and
rattle. It’s a hash, old man, a hash!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what I cannot understand,” Eliphalet was saying
five minutes later, “is how you could put such words into
the mouth of a clergyman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t,” came the plaintive reply. “I only left them
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no cleric would say such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think for yourself—would he, o’ man? ‘Mentally cauterised,’
and all that kind of stuff! Bad form!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mr. Cardomay expressly asked me to keep the
spirit of the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You took me too literally, Mr. Lennard. No self-respecting
member of the Church would turn his wife out
of doors in the middle of the night. He would wrestle
with her mentally. There is a fine chance in that scene
for inspired rhetoric. Think! Something that starts gently
and gradually, crescendoes as the wealth of this theme
reveals itself. Why, it comes to my brain as easily as
if the trouble were my own.” He began to pace up and
down, saying, “God gave you into my keeping, and I shall
not let you go. For the sake of that great love that once
was ours—love consecrated by holy matrimony, cemented
by the hands of little children—put behind you these
dark thoughts, my dear, these sinful, useless hopes. Shun
this evil phantom that rises like a—a—something—in our
path. Bear your part in the great trust—the trust of a
wife and a mother.” He paused dramatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the stuff,” chipped in Freddie Manning. “And
the girl finishes up by crying in his arms, and the house
shouts itself sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to my way of thinking,” hazarded Mr. Lennard
politely, “no woman would stop in the room if her
husband talked like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there you are,” said Manning. “That’s a jolly
good way of getting her off—much better than pitching her
through the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us approach the matter rationally,” suggested Eliphalet,
although he was not a little distressed at the reception
given to his oratory. “Having gone so far, I am
not anxious to relinquish the play. Even if only on account
of the title, I confess I am drawn towards it. I suggest,
Mr. Lennard, that you leave the manuscript with
me to work upon. It would save much fruitless discussion.
I should bring to bear a fresh eye, cultivated to observe and
remedy the existing faults. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you please,” said the young man hopelessly.
“I don’t suppose I should ever get what you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the fortnight in which Eliphalet laboured at “A
Man’s Way” he had constant resource to manuscripts of
old plays in his repertory, most particularly to one called
“The Vespers,” in which a clergyman and his wife passed
through troubled waters. In this work Right throve persistently,
mainly through the good offices of much Homeric
matter delivered from the centre of the stage and etherealised
by the influences of the Spot Lime or Red Glow from
Fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was not an author, and he began to work tentatively.
But after a while he found that to give any real
tone value to the scenes and characters it was necessary
to carry out very extensive alterations. It is possible to
keep gold-fish in an aviary. In certain elements only a
certain class of life can exist. Influences in one breath to
say “Chuck it and clear out” in the next. Wherefore, for
every line Eliphalet altered there arose an immediate obligation
to alter a hundred succeeding lines. And this duty,
with the aid of his reference library, i.e., the Repertory
Plays, he most conscientiously performed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! with the change of text came a fresh trouble.
Situations had to be re-constructed to fit the new psychology.
Nothing daunted, Eliphalet dipped afresh into his
old lore, and emerged with stilted and stereotyped scenes
which he faithfully paraphrased and transplanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the finished article bore about as much resemblance
to “A Man’s Way” as a cow to a nightingale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Eliphalet Cardomay! The quicksands of tradition
would not let him go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Freddie Manning, “it’s more like our usual
stuff now.” He took out a cigarette, which he licked
thoughtfully before lighting “But I was thinking——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t it struck you, Guv’nor, that the title ‘A Man’s
Way,’ doesn’t fit any longer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet looked quite scared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I like the title enormously. It’s so original—er—modern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it don’t belong, Guv’nor. It gives the wrong idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye-es, I see what you mean. With this more ascetic
character, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly.” He rubbed his nose productively. “ ‘A Man’s
Prayer’ would be better,” he hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet thought it over and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it ain’t good. How about ‘The Great Trust?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds a shade American, Manning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet struck the table. “I have it,” he said. “ ‘His
Prayer.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the note!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let Lennard know we have decided to call it
that. And you might take back some of these to the theatre.”
He indicated the pile of plays on his table from
which his alterations had been quarried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Manning carried off these veterans of the Road,
and having nothing better to do for an hour he perused
the four acts of “The Vespers” and became pregnant of
an idea. He said nothing about it at the theatre that
night, but the following morning, when, faithful to his
usual routine, he paid his eleven o’clock call on his master,
he had every intention of doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile Eliphalet had passed a troubled night.
Dispassionately and clear-headedly he had been through
“His Prayer” (late “A Man’s Way”) and had given it
deep thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had chosen this work because he believed it would lift
him from the Old School and place him among the moderns,
and lo! it was even as all his other plays. He had
been deceived. There was not a spark of originality in
it. It was set and stereotyped, lifeless and dull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, why did I ever believe in the thing?” recurred
over and over again in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So before Manning had a chance to speak a word, he
was saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have made a most grievous error in the matter of
‘A Man’s Way.’ It’s no good, Manning—no good at all,
and I cannot conceive how I ever thought it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all liable to mistakes, Guv’nor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet shook his head. “Perhaps I am getting old,”
he said, “and losing my sense of good and ill. Why, even
with the alterations I have so laboriously contrived, it
does not compare with the poorest play in our repertoire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning slapped his hat on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guv’nor,” he said, “that’s what I’m here to say. It
all comes of trying to get off our own railway system.
Now what’s wrong with doing ‘The Vespers’ instead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Pon my soul,” said Eliphalet, “I believe it would bear
reviving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would—and not a cent to pay, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet leant back and rubbed his fingers together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The Vespers?’ ” he spoke the title lovingly. “Why,
Manning, it must be twenty years since I played ‘The
Vespers.’ Ah, Manning, they knew how to write—those
old ’uns. They had poetry, understanding. This ultra-modern
business is all wrong, Manning, all wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all wrong for us, Guv’nor.” He did not overstress
the “us,” but it had a meaning which Eliphalet was not
slow to perceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the cobbler stick to his last,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning rose abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll send Lennard a letter and return the script.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Eliphalet, “I’ll do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manning eyed him doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are under no obligation to pay him anything, Guv’nor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—no. Of course not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nevertheless there was a cheque for forty pounds
in the letter he posted. Perhaps subconsciously, he was
paying for a lesson and not for a play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Eliphalet touch. He, too, had had his disappointments,
and maybe, this was one of them. No man
should raise hopes and dash them to the ground.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GAS WORKS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The effects of international politics are far-reaching.
But for them Eliphalet Cardomay would certainly
have produced “The Vespers.” The declaration of peace
in South Africa was the direct cause of his abandoning the
project. A wave of patriotism seized him, and on its
impulse he purchased the touring rights of a great military
melodrama, entitled “The Flag,” which had been accorded
considerable success in a London theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this play he figured as a dashing, if rather improbable
Colonel, whose courage was to be relied upon in any extremity.
The extremities were many and dire, but never
failed to find our hero alert, sententious, resourceful and
with an inexhaustible supply of cigarettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truth to tell, the part was not eminently suited, either
to his personality or method. Colonels do not, as a rule,
wear much hair upon the temples or nape of the neck,
nor do they engage unduly in gesture or vocalisation. Eliphalet,
on the other hand, did all these things—declining
to sacrifice his established traditions on the shrine of convention.
His “Colonel,” therefore, was an indifferent impersonation
less like unto a soldier than unto Van Biene in
“The Broken Melody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last scene of the play there was a great “to do”;
nothing less, in short, than a bombardment and assault
upon the Consulate which the Colonel and his brave followers
were defending. With heavy odds against them,
these gallant few contrived to hold out until the opportune
arrival of a rescue-party headed by the Colonel’s young and
lovely daughter, and heralded by a fife-and-drum band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the bombardment was in progress the Colonel
and a faithful orderly had the stage to themselves. The
courageous soldier spent his time between an open cigarette-box
and an open window, from which latter vantage
he was able to control the movements of his troops, and
supply the audience with details of the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay had been at great pains to make
the sounds of the battle convincing. He had bought large
drums and employed extra hands to beat the stage with
canes. As a final <span class='it'>tour de force</span> half a dozen squibs were
let off, a single maroon was exploded in an iron bucket, and
red fire was burnt with liberality in an adjacent frying-pan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a stirring entertainment. Eliphalet felt he was
upholding the best traditions of the race and drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the second week of the tour his satisfaction received
a shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was staying at an hotel, the rooms in that particular
town being indifferent and unclean, and had returned
thither after the performance to sip a cup of cocoa and
smoke a small cigar before retiring to rest. He had found
a secluded palm-sheltered recess in the lounge, and, at the
time the shock occurred, was reflecting that he had, perhaps,
allowed himself too free an expression of criticism
when discussing with the theatre manager the matter of
exits from the auditorium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own production was a heavy one, and to give it
stage room the manager had moved a quantity of stock
scenery and stored it in the two emergency corridors which,
in case of necessity, would empty the theatre into a narrow
thoroughfare at the back. Eliphalet did not approve
of this measure and had quoted the Lord Chamberlain’s
rules in support. Mr. Gimball, the manager, had replied,
with singular lack of courtesy, that he was quite capable
of running the front of the house without interference. To
this Eliphalet answered, “Your first duty to your patrons
is to provide them with a speedy means of leaving the
auditorium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mr. Gimball returned:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can get them out all right if you can get them in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An uncalled-for observation, the memory of which
rankled. Eliphalet did not aspire to be a master of repartee,
and had not engaged in the discussion with a view
to sharpening his wits. It seemed obvious every precaution
should be taken, especially in the case of a theatre
situated next-door to a small-arms and cartridge-making
factory and abutting the local gas-works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it is not unnatural that, in the shade of the hotel
palms, he should have sought for more quieting influences.
He was sipping the cocoa, when he chanced to overhear the
following conversation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t forgive you for this, Bryan, when we might
have spent a pleasant evening at a music-hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” said an older voice, “but after all it wasn’t
such a bad show. Certainly the battle scene was a bit
indifferent—still, one can’t expect everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit indifferent! It was deplorable. But, apart from
that, the way that old actor, what’s his name, played the
part of the Colonel was enough to drive a man to drink.
Going about, smiling, cracking jests, and lighting cigarettes!
I’ve been through a decent few shows—Dundee,
Barterton, and some others that were pretty warm, too—and
I can tell you, people don’t behave like that under
shell-fire—they’ve too much to think about to play the
mountebank. Carry on with the work and show decent
pluck—yes. But behave like that old idiot—no, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re blasé with too much of the real thing, my dear
Raeburn. Let’s have a drink and talk about something
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the South African warrior was not to be denied.
He had things to say, and meant to say them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half the time,” he continued, ignoring the interruption,
“these actor-Johnnies don’t know what they’re doing. A
slack, idle crowd, lolling over a bar by day and messing up
their faces with grease-paint by night. They’ve no experience
of life, or death, or danger, and wouldn’t know how to
cope with it if they had. They’re gas-works, that’s all.
Lord, it makes me sick to see a man attitudinising and throwing
the heroic pose, when if it came to a pinch he’d take
to his heels at the sight of a runaway horse half-a-mile
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That statement,” said Eliphalet Cardomay, rising and
approaching the two gentlemen, “is offensive and unjust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who had been speaking, a broad-shouldered,
well-built fellow of middle age, spun round in his chair,
and eyed the newcomer with disfavour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not aware we invited you to join our conversation,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay acknowledged the thrust with a
fencer’s gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True; but I feel justified in upholding the honour of
my profession, as doubtless you would feel for any person
or ideal you may happen to cherish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Raeburn cocked his head at a somewhat insolent
angle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, then, draw up a chair and let’s have it out.
It would simplify matters to exchange names. Mine is
Raeburn—Captain Raeburn—and this is Mr. Bryan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old actor bowed ceremoniously to each in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine,” he said, “is Eliphalet Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the expression of surprise on their faces it was clear,
until this moment, they had failed to recognise in him
the gallant Colonel of an hour before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it, begad?” said Raeburn. “Then our conversation
must have been devilish unpleasant overhearing.” He offered
no apology, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet shrugged his shoulders and, dividing the tails
of his long, old-fashioned frock-coat, sat down at the small
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bryan was of more sensitive metal than his companion,
and felt the need to smooth some of the creases from
the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raeburn,” he said, with a conciliatory laugh, “says a
good deal he doesn’t mean. You know what it is! Personally,
I am sorry you should have overheard his criticisms—very
sorry indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad I did,” was the response, “for it gives me
the chance of refuting them. It is not very agreeable for
us to have people saying in public that we lack the essential
elements of courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, well!” said Raeburn with brusque heartiness,
“a word spoken is a bullet fired. No use pretending
you didn’t touch the trigger, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is it not unwise to tamper with firearms when you
are not acquainted with their mechanism?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeburn coloured a trifle and remarked, “That’s hardly
applicable to me, Mr. Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was merely enlarging a metaphor you introduced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—I see. Yes. But how about a drink before we
start? You won’t refuse a whisky, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may find it hard to believe, but I shall refuse;
for oddly enough, and at the risk of destroying one of your
illusions, I do not drink alcohol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Well, that’s a score to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could shatter other beliefs as easily. You said
we of the stage have no real experience of life, death and
danger, and could not cope with it if we had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, on the other hand, maintain that we have a greater
experience than almost any other class. We must know
what to do for every occasion, for otherwise we would need
at once to seek a fresh means of livelihood—or starve.
We live amidst a turmoil of ever-changing emotions——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Acted emotions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But very real to us. What we depict is merely what
we have known or seen or felt. All our lives we are moving
in different scenes and different places—we are rubbing
shoulders week by week with different men, different
women, and human events, both great and small, which
even you, with your battle-field experiences, would find it
hard to outrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeburn made no reply, but the angle of his nostrils
was distinctly sceptical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, all the time we are drawing our experiences—learning
our lesson from the book of life. A child pricks its
finger—and we can study from the child’s mother the
measure of sympathy she offers for so small a sorrow, yes,
and deduce therefrom how great her sympathy and concern
would be if the pricked finger were, instead, a mortal
malady. There is no happening too small to be of use to
us, to help us with our lesson; and every hour of the day
or night we are piecing together the minute mosaic which
goes to fashion the broad patterns of our art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m! That’s all very nice and very interesting, but
forgive me if I don’t exactly see what it’s leading up to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merely this: that from the lesson we have learnt, we,
of all people, are to be relied upon to do the right thing
in any emergency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Raeburn found the loophole he had been seeking,
and fired his shaft unceremoniously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why, my dear sir, play that last scene in ‘The
Flag’ in the manner you do? Surely you don’t imagine
a Colonel would really behave like that under similar conditions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Although I have never been in a battle, I can see no
reason against his doing so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can take it from me that he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the risk of appearing disputatious, I contend, if it
were his wish to allay a spirit of panic, that is precisely
the way he would set about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the men would laugh at him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In which case he would have achieved his object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, well! You could talk from now to dooms-day
and not convince me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry,” said Eliphalet, rising. “It was good
of you to hear me so patiently. Good night.” He hesitated.
“I was wondering—you fought in South Africa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, all through the campaign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have heard and seen many stiff engagements?”
Raeburn nodded. “You were commenting unfavourably
upon the effects of the battle that I introduce in the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Raeburn produced a cigar and lit it. “ ’Fraid
I was,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it be asking too much from you to—to explain
in what direction our effects differ from the reality?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s an awkward question to answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning we are entirely at fault?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something of the kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet sat down again and looked worried. “That’s
a pity,” he said. “A great pity. I should like to have
it right. Perhaps, if you—er——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeburn spread out his legs. It was evident he rather
enjoyed this tribute to his professional skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, I will. Now, let’s see. These rebels are
at the gate, aren’t they? A few shots are fired—answered
by rifle-fire from the defenders. That ’ud want
organising to a certain extent. There’d be time in it—they’re
trained troops—see? Probably a machine-gun
would open up somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had begun to take notes on the back of an
envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A machine-gun—very good,” he said. “Now, how
would that sound?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeburn tapped his forefinger in a metrical beat upon
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see, I see. Please continue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there some talk about the rebels bringing up
artillery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; they open fire on the consulate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that was where you were all over the place. First,
you want a low, distant report, then a whistle—SShhreeee—e—u—u—cr—umpp.
Something like that they go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very effective! This is most valuable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the subtle influence of appreciation the warrior
developed his theme and gave many graphic illustrations
of the din of battle, each of which the stage mind of Eliphalet
Cardomay rapidly translated to the possible resources of
the property-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finally, when the rebels blow up the gate you want a
noise—a real noise. That twopenny maroon you explode
wouldn’t lift a wicket off a nursery door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I thought that effect was fairly good,” said Eliphalet
plaintively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only tell you it made me laugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must change it, then—it must be changed at once.
I pride myself on presenting nothing but the best to my
audience. Many thanks, Captain Raeburn; you have
rendered me a great service. I shall rehearse the battle-scene
very thoroughly and utilise all your valuable suggestions.
If you and your friend would honour me by accepting
a box for Friday night’s performance, I think I
can promise you a reflection of the real thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably Mr. Bryan realised that Raeburn would drop
a brick, so without giving him time to refuse he gracefully
accepted the invitation on behalf of both. And when
Eliphalet had wished them “Good night” and departed,
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d insulted him quite enough, my dear fellow; we
should have been inexcusably rude to have said ‘No.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A silly old gas-bag,” smiled Raeburn. “We’ll go, then.
Anything for a laugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, and the one following, Eliphalet Cardomay and
his stage-manager, Freddie Manning, worked at the battle-scene
like grim death. The artillery practice achieved with
drums of different notes and a develine whistle was a
triumph of realism. A stern suggestion of machine gunnery
was contrived by the use of an archaic police rattle,
opportunely unearthed from a neighbouring junk shop. For
the mining of the gate a large cistern was salvaged from a
rubbish-heap and two maroons were placed inside and fired
simultaneously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manning,” exclaimed Eliphalet gleefully, “it is tremendous!
Now, just once more, and we’ll leave it at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way back to the hotel he chanced to meet Captain
Raeburn, who was swinging a cane in Broaden Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall surprise you to-night,” he said, by way of
greeting, and passed on, chuckling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Grand Theatre, Wadley, was situated at the top
end of a short blind road, standing back from Broaden
Street. The stage-door and emergency exits, which, it will
be remembered, were blocked with scenery, opened on a
narrow thoroughfare at the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Approaching the box-office, one passed Messrs. Felder &amp;
Syme’s Small Arms and Cartridge factory. Behind them,
and separated only by a ten-foot wall, one of the many
urban gasometers rose and fell in response to the city’s consumption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Friday night in Wadley was always the best for business.
It was then the “good people” patronised the drama, and
Mr. Gimball, the manager, was wont to make special efforts
for their better comfort. On Friday there were extra
members in the orchestra. On Friday there was red cloth on
the front steps. On Friday all the electric light points
burnt gaily in the big lustre chandelier above the auditorium,
and woe betide the programme-girl that failed to
appear in her whitest and newest apron upon that night of
nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the returns were brought to Eliphalet Cardomay at
the close of the second act, he was agreeably pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve a fine audience for our new battle,” he observed,
“and the play is going well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Raeburn sat back in his box, the picture of misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he remonstrated, “that fellow Cardomay is
awful. How about slipping quietly away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Bryan would not hear of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Small Arms factory next door the night-watchman
was making himself comfortable against his vigil. By means
of a pile of straw-filled cases he constructed an easy-chair.
The light of the small caged gas-jet being insufficient to
illuminate his Late Football Extra, he produced from his
pocket a stump of candle and waxed it to the top of one
of the cases. This done, he ensconced himself luxuriously,
spread out the paper, and settled down for a “nice read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the third act of “The Flag” proceeded. Eddies
of rebellion were already lapping against the walls of
the consulate. The Colonel’s daughter, disguised as a gipsy,
had dropped from the walls and was away in search of aid—and
the audience had begun to realise that in the next act
there would be trouble, with a capital “T.” They were
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The print of the halfpenny Football Edition, held in the
hands of the night-watchman, began to blur. Delicious
little thrills of fatigue pulsed through his limbs. He reflected
how foolish he had been never before to have disposed
himself so comfortably. Also he reflected how good
that pint of dinner ale had been, partaken before coming
on duty. Odd thing he had never drunk of dinner ale
before! In the future he would remedy that omission—a
rounder, mellower and more palatable beverage would be
hard to conceive. He closed his eyes and allowed his imagination
to picture the big glass tankard and the burnt Sienna
distillation it had contained. He tried to open them
again but they revolted against the impulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aft’ all,” he muttered, “aft’ all—wha’s it marrer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The paper slipped from his fingers and dropped to the
top of the case beside the candle. His hand made a lumbering,
futile gesture to regain it, then fell to his knee and
skidded off inertly. His head rolled a trifle, lurched forward
and his body went limp. Then came the heavy regular
purr of a man breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A capricious draught slanted the flame of the candle until
it gently touched the corner of the newspaper. Being damp,
the paper burnt slowly and only in one direction. Finally
it went out, but not before setting light to an enthusiastic
wisp of straw. The straw realised at once what was required,
and passed the dancing yellow flame along the ridge
of the line of overflowing cases. The lids of the cases were
screwed down and the heat generated from the burning
wisps of protruding straw was insufficient to ignite them.
This was very disappointing, for very soon the straw had
burnt out and, but for one insignificant circumstance, a
very enjoyable fire would have been lost to the neighbourhood.
The circumstance in question was provided by a
stump of pencil which hung on a string from a notice-board.
A final spurt of flame from the last tuft of straw ignited
the little piece of cedar-wood, which—nothing if not communicative—promptly
conveyed its sorrow to the string
supporting it. The string burnt through and the flaming
pencil dropped to the floor upon a little heap of paper and
rubbish. In these sympathetic surroundings it received
every encouragement, and in very little time the whole pile
was blazing merrily. A chance puff of wind from an open
doorway scattered fragments in three directions, in each of
which a cheerful fire resulted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The packing-room, a few feet down the passage, where
stacks of empty cartridge-boxes were stored, was, perhaps,
the most successful; although, considering the non-inflammable
nature of much of its contents, the small recess beneath
the wooden staircase competed very creditably. The
third fire was insignificant, confining itself to the cremation
of a row of overalls hanging on a line of hooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the night-watchman woke, he found himself confronted
with a task beyond the reaches of his capacity. His
rush to the fire rack resulted in oversetting two buckets of
water, and the flames, laughing at his failure, tore down the
ceiling of the packing-room and mounted gleefully to the
storey above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain had just risen on the last act when Mr. Gimball
burst through the iron door and almost fell upon Eliphalet
Cardomay, waiting in the wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cartridge factory next door is ablaze,” he gasped,
“and the sparks are pouring down by the box-office. Drop
the iron curtain and we’ll get the audience out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once!” assented Cardomay. “But wait a moment—if
the stuff is falling outside, will they be able to pass?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! I don’t know—I doubt it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are five minutes before my entrance. Take me
somewhere where I can see—quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gimball hurried him through the iron door and up
some private stairs. At the end of a corridor they found a
window, and looked down at the street below. Flames were
pouring from the factory and the walls bulged dangerously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Useless,” said Eliphalet. “We must empty the house
through the emergency exits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he remembered, and looked at Mr. Gimball with
condemning eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall lose my licence for this,” muttered the manager
hoarsely. “There’s only one way for it—we must pass them
through the iron door and out across the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fool!” (It was most unusual for Eliphalet to say a
thing like that.) “You fool! Pass three hundred people
through a two-foot doorway? There’d be a panic—a horrible
panic. We must clear those blocked exits, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll take an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do it in a quarter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in the meantime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the meantime we will play the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my God, don’t you realise that place is full of
explosives? Even if we’re not blown up, the row——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you realise it is a battle scene we shall be
playing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as fast as his years would carry him, he hurried
back to the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What orders, Guv’nor?” said Manning, who, through
the open door of the scene entrance, could see the progress
of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get all your men, Manning, everyone who is not actually
playing, and clear the stuff from the emergency exits. The
front of the house is impassable. Make a job of it, Manning,
while I hold the audience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right!” said Manning. “Now, boys, every one of you.”
He was stripping off his coat as Eliphalet heard his cue
and walked on to the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even through the make-up, fear was written large on
the face of old Kitterson, who played the orderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in for a rough time,” said Eliphalet, speaking
from the text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a sharp, insistent crackle—almost merged into
a single report. A shelf of twelve-bore cartridges had gone
up next door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet took a cigarette from his case and lit it steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, man,” he said lightly, between the puffs, “you
are not afraid—are you?” He stretched out his hand and
gripped old Kitterson’s arm with a warning pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been through too much together to show the
white feather now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half his words were lost in the roar and crackle from
outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Raeburn touched his friend’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Altering the lines, aren’t they?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn good effect of something burning. You can almost
smell the smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had smelt the smoke too. It made him cough,
so he impromptued quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devils have fired the outbuildings. Phew! how the
infernal fumes choke one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode over to the window, through which, and beyond
the edge of the back cloth, the open scene door gave a view
of the factory fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great geysers of flame were spouting from the back windows
and reaching loving hands toward the gasometer, not
sixty feet distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Kitterson had followed and he, too, saw and realised
the waiting danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!” he exclaimed. “If that catches!” And there was
a note of terror in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Eliphalet thoughtfully, “if they fire the magazine
it would not be pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kitterson was plucking his sleeve and beckoning him to
come away, but Eliphalet threw the old fellow from him
with a fine flash of anger in his voice and eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we are to die,” he cried, “we will die like soldiers and
gentlemen—at our posts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a hoarse, solid detonation, followed by a splutter
of little reports and the sharp stink of gunpowder filled
the auditorium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some ladies in the stalls moved restively, and complained
it was too realistic. In the gallery a girl shrieked, and some
boys mocked her with their laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay was sitting on the window-sill, lighting
a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done, lads,” he cried to his imaginary forces below.
“A few more like that, and we——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crash!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great piece of the factory wall fell noisily into the yard,
and the released flames poured out toward the gasometer.
Eliphalet could feel the sweat breaking out upon his forehead.
He almost prayed for that devastating flash which
would end the charade. But a gentle wind took the matter
in hand and fanned the tongues of flame away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De—dinga—longa—longalong. De—dong—along—along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The engines were coming. He had forgotten the possibility
of that sound and the message of terror it might convey
to the audience. If the truth leaked out there would be
a panic. They would find the front of the theatre impassable,
and battle with each other in the blocked exits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he burst into a great shout of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some idiot is ringing the fire bell!” he shouted. “Ha!
the fool. Come, Weldon; don’t you see the joke? Laugh,
man; laugh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make this out,” Raeburn was saying. “Wait
here a minute. I am going to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped from the box and ran down a deserted corridor.
On his left he heard the sound of men’s voices and the
moving of heavy objects. He pushed open a door labelled
“Extra Exit” and found Manning with a crowd of furiously
working actors and stage hands humping large scene flats
into the street at the back. They worked as though their
very lives depended upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” demanded Raeburn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Manning scarcely looked in his direction, but
he jerked out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away and keep your mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeburn took the hint, and made his way to the box-office.
The road outside was blocked with fallen débris and
mantled in a smother of smoke. It cleared for a second, long
enough to show him half a dozen engines farther down,
with brass-helmeted firemen busy paying out the hose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clinging to one of the theatre pillars was the night-watchman—a
shivering wreck of what so short a time before had
been a fine connoisseur of dinner ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s thousands o’ rounds up there,” he dithered,
pointing at the still-to-catch top storey. “And if they
don’t set off the gas-works, may I never touch another
pint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Captain Raeburn understood many things, and he
returned to his box to watch the man he had belittled deal
with emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay had got his second wind and was
holding the audience with a light but firm rein. He was
jesting with death at his elbow—tickling the feet of Fate,
and strewing the stage with half-smoked cigarettes. Old
Kitterson, fired by example, had braced his shoulders for
the ordeal and was doing his best to help the Guv’nor in
his hour of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reverted to the original text when Raeburn re-entered
the box, and Kitterson was saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are piling explosives beneath the main gate, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall go to our Maker with a better speed, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there nothing we can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, if the relief is not in time. We have still our
prayers and a generous supply of these excellent cigarettes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kitterson (at the window): “Ah! they are lighting the
fuse. They move away from it. It burns slowly—Guv’nor—sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost with a single impulse the entire audience clapped
hands over his ears, and, by a caprice of fortune, some
thousands of rounds of best smokeless cartridges detonated
with a hollow, paralysing roar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole building shook. The long line of the back-cloth
snapped, and it swung down from a single tether.
Several women went into hysterics, and a quantity of plaster
mouldings fell from the roof and splattered among the
audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was silence—no sound but the soothing hiss
of water on red-hot beams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay, with arms folded, stood in the middle
of the stage, a queer smile playing about his lips; Kitterson
had dropped his head in his hands and was crouching
beside a table; and then the door burst open, and little
Violet O’Neal, “the Colonel’s daughter,” followed by two
men in officers’ uniforms, burst upon the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” she gasped. “The danger—the worst is
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly her part came back to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rebels are flying,” she cried. “You’re safe—safe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet, Colonel and father, caught her to his breast,
smothering something she was saying about the gasometer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God has rescued us, my child—God is very good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Manning, who had dashed up from the street a
second before, was just in time to ring down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exits all clear, Guv’nor,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take up the curtain, then,” said Eliphalet; and when it
rose he stepped forward to the footlights and, holding up
his hand for silence, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies and gentlemen, will you kindly leave the theatre
by the right and left emergency exits. There has been
a fire in the street by the box-office, so this way will be more
convenient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed—turned with a pardonable instinct towards the
box in which Raeburn and his friend were standing, and
favoured them with a very slight smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain fell and the audience, in some perplexity, but
without panic, filed out of the theatre to the narrow alley
at the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cardomay,” said Gimball, “I reckon you’ve saved
my licence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It had not occurred to me I had so important a task to
fulfil,” returned Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can tell you I’m grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you will at least admit I kept them in the theatre
and got them out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>foyer</span> of the hotel Captain Raeburn was waiting,
a broad hand outstretched to greet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You flirted with death better than anyone I’ve struck
yet,” he said. “I estimate you have saved a hundred lives
to-night, Mr. Cardomay. Are you big enough to accept
an apology?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flush of pride spread over Eliphalet’s rugose features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am small enough to be deeply flattered by it,” he
replied, as he took the proffered hand. “Yet, after all, it
was a simple enough matter. I had but to follow my training—to
give them a few whiffs from the gas-works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I deserve it, Colonel,” Raeburn acknowledged, “and a
good kicking besides. But look here, after all this, surely
you’ll have a drink to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet smiled whimsically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes,” he said, “I should enjoy a cup of cocoa very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have it your own way,” laughed Raeburn, and gave
the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet divided the tails of his coat and sat himself
comfortably on a cane chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Despite our earnest preparations, you never heard the
new battle effects, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I heard was pretty convincing, though!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye—es! But still, it’s disappointing. Now, if you and
your friend would accept a box for to-morrow night——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Raeburn had the good grace to answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing I should enjoy more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay stretched himself luxuriously
on a green-painted arm-chair by the Achilles
Statue in Hyde Park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wearing a new broad-brimmed grey felt hat, and
the seasonableness of his attire spread to a pair of dark
felt spats, below which the bright spring sunshine reflected
itself on the surface of his well-blacked boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was pleasing to lounge under the new-foliaged plane
trees and watch fashionable London sedately disporting itself
on the gravel paths—to see the riders cantering in the
Row, and to hear the “clot-clot” and pleasant jingle of
harness as the smart people drove by. Something in the
pageantry of it all appealed to his dramatic sense. Piccadilly—the
Strand—Oxford Street—awoke no sympathetic
chords in his being—he was more at ease and happier in
any of the great thoroughfares of Manchester, Leeds or
Glasgow, but this great meeting-place of England’s noblest-born
stirred him strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tide of well-dressed men and beautifully-gowned
women set his mind upon a sad train of thought. They
were not for him, these select; his poster on a hoarding
they would pass by without a second glance. They belonged
to the great ones of the London stage—that mighty little
clique whose doors were barred to such as he. That very
morning he had seen a few of the upper theatrical ten
walking in the Park, and, even as the thought crossed his
mind, Sir Charles Cleeve, an actor knight, and his fashionable
wife, drove past in a high phaeton drawn by a pair
of piebalds. A real live duchess turned in her carriage to
smile a greeting to them. (Eliphalet knew she was a duchess,
for he had often seen her portrait in the illustrated
weeklies, hanging on Smith’s book-stalls in the Midland
stations.) A clever woman Sir Charles’s wife. All the
world knew that the high ground he now held unchallenged
had in part been won for him by her tireless energy, tact and
charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great thing for an actor to possess such a wife.
He fell to wondering whether, had his choice been as happy,
he, too, might not have been a member of the Garrick
Club, a driver of phaetons, a recipient of smiles from duchesses.
He could hardly refrain from smiling at the thought
of the figure his wife would have cut in polite society. Yet
she had been an able enough actress in her day. Poor
Blanche—poor, empty-headed, self-centred, easy-virtued
Blanche. It required an effort to reconstruct her picture in
his mind. Twenty-seven years is a long time, and even
pleasant pictures had faded in less. Once he had loved
her, like a very Romeo, and set her on a pinnacle higher
than any balcony. He shivered, as with horrible clarity he
saw the night when, returning late from the theatre (there
had been a rehearsal after the show), he had found her in
their wretched little parlour, drinking a wretched brand
of champagne with Harrington May, the leading-man. The
same Harrington May who had fled from the field of honour—to
return later, as a fly returns to a pot of jam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone has supper with everyone else on the provincial
stage. It is one of the best and friendliest traditions of the
Road, and Eliphalet, born and bred of the Boards, would
have thought no ill to find her entertaining one or a dozen
men at any hour of the night. But this was different. It
was not the friendly little repast with its scrambled eggs
and rattle of theatrical shop; it was frankly a carouse.
There were empty tinselled bottles on the table, and those
down whose throats the liquid had passed were drunk—Harrington
May dully, and his wife stupidly. She had her
head on the man’s shoulder, and was laughing in a loose,
trumpery way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was useless to talk to them, for May was not in a state
to distinguish between flattery and abuse, while she was in
a mood to say things no man would desire a third person
to hear. Accordingly, he postponed his observations until
next morning, and when that came it appeared she had the
more to say. With bitter emphasis she stated that, as a
husband, Eliphalet fell far short of her ideals. Apart from
the miserable salary he earned, which, in itself, was an insult
to a woman who was earning a larger one (for Blanche
was playing the villainess and he the juvenile, and in those
days virtue was cheaper than crime), she abhorred his studious
nature, his ridiculous name, and his attitude towards
life in general. She was of a lively temperament—a temperament
calling for plenty of sparkle and sunshine (he had
thought of those empty bottles downstairs), and accordingly
had decided to leave him for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet offered little or no opposition. He had known
for a long while that sooner or later their ill-assorted union
would come to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” he had said; “I won’t stand in the way of
your happiness. You shall have a divorce as soon as it can
be arranged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of regarding this as a token of goodwill, Blanche
had reviled him. It was obvious, she cried, he had no love
for her, and merely made her his wife for the sake of the
better salary she earned; and—now he seized the chance
of a divorce in the hope of wringing heavy damages from
Harrington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want no damages,” he replied. “Maybe I shall find
my reward without.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet did not have a speaking part in the scene that
followed. His first line was “Thank God,” and that was
after the door had slammed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Harrington May assumed responsibilities for Eliphalet
Cardomay’s matrimonial obligations, and when the
decree <span class='it'>nisi</span> was made absolute, he took “Miss Blanche Cannon”
to be his lawful wedded wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the union had turned out Eliphalet never knew,
since from the hour she left his house he had met neither
the one nor the other. Indirectly he heard that as fruit of
their love a daughter had been born—and that was the only
thing for which he envied Harrington May. He might have
saved himself the trouble, for poor Harrington, possibly
from ecstasy at the sight of this miniature edition of her
faultless mother, shortly afterwards gave up the ghost.
Blanche, whose appreciation for a change of diet had not
waned with his decease, took unto herself a lover, and fades
from view in a mist of misguided emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me! Surely I am not mistaken—it is Mr. Cardomay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of his own name Eliphalet’s mind came back
to the present with a jolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing before him, leaning on an ebony cane, stood a
middle-aged gentleman, faultlessly dressed and of aristocratic
bearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet rose. “I am,” he said, “but for the moment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—no,” hastily interposed the other, “you could
hardly be expected to remember me. Both you and I, Mr.
Cardomay, in our separate spheres, are engaged in catering
for these.” He made a slight gesture toward the passers-by.
“We met but once, and that on the occasion of your
very admirable performance of Cellini.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet blushed at the words, although no undercurrent
of satire was conveyed. That same “very admirable
performance of Cellini” stood for him as a door that barred
him from London theatres for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” he said, to hide his confusion, “I do remember
you. Mr. Bridge Deansgate, who owns the Mall Theatre,
is it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Deansgate smiled affably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But please don’t stand,” he begged. “And, if I may, I
will sit beside you. That’s better. Yes, yes, yes; I often
wonder why we see so little of you in town, Mr. Cardomay—but
perhaps your presence here betokens——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” came the hasty assurance. “I am spending a few
weeks’ holiday before my next tour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed. I understand your recent production was a great
success—great. You are stopping in Mayfair—near the
Park—yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some rooms in Camden Town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah. I have often heard it spoken of as a most healthy
district. For the moment I forget the nature of the soil—gravel,
I believe. And so you are taking a few weeks’
immunity from work? Umhum! Yes—yes. Now I wonder—but
still, if you are resting, perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were about to suggest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, nothing. A fleeting idea, that is all, prompted
by this happy encounter. As doubtless you have heard,
we are producing ‘Hamlet’ for four weeks, and it occurred
to me—but perhaps I should offend you. We have an admirable
cast, and in many ways it would be a pleasant engagement.
You see, nowadays it is so hard to find actors
who still understand the grand old method.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He inclined his head gracefully to Eliphalet, who bowed
in response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am disposed to be interested,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the Ghost, now, where is a manager to turn? That
very thought was possessing my brain when I chanced to
look up and see you. If you are not otherwise engaged,
how would it be to stroll to the Corner and pick up a hansom?
They have a <span class='it'>chef</span> at the Garrick with a true appreciation
of how a Châteaubriand should be cooked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upshot of this conversation and an excellent lunch
was to find Eliphalet Cardomay, at three o’clock the same
afternoon, discussing terms with the business manager of
the Mall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never talk about money,” Mr. Deansgate had said.
“Tell Dawson to give you what you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winslow Dawson was an agreeable little man, who had the
habit of paying less than you intended to accept, at the
same time conveying the impression that you had bested
him all along the line. He carried his hands permanently
in his trousers pockets, from whence they never appeared to
emerge, even when a door had to be opened or shut or a
contract signed. He performed these functions, so it seemed,
by some balancing feat of prestidigitation. He had a habit
of balancing on his heels and contemplating his patent-leather
toes. He would remain thus during a long discussion,
then look up with the sunniest of smiles and say,
“Then that’s settled, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Eliphalet left the theatre it was in a very happy
mood. After all, he would appear in London again, and—what
was better still—in a part regarding the rendering
of which he could scarcely be at fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Deansgate had said, “Do just as you like with it,
my dear Cardomay; we have every confidence in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In honour of the occasion he stood himself tea at Fuller’s
and ate quite a large piece of walnut cake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A delightful management,” he reflected. “This is better
than a holiday, old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps he felt a shade awkward at the rehearsal next
morning to find the stage thronged with so many unfamiliar
faces, but for the most part they were a friendly
company, and very soon he was quite at ease with the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies he found difficult, being so totally dissimilar
to the homely, good-natured souls who played with him on
his hundred tours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a Miss Helen Winter, who played the Queen
and whose personality caused him alarm. She seemed far
more like a duchess than the real example he had seen in
the Park. Her clothes were severe to a fault, and she used
lorgnettes with awful precision. Somehow the sense of these
instruments pervaded her even in the Castle of Elsinore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were introduced she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, <span class='it'>dear</span> Mr. Cardomay. I have heard so
much about you.” Then departed quickly, as though fearing
he might be tempted to tell her more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Ophelia one of London’s younger emotional actresses
had been secured. Her emotions were more acutely demonstrated
off the stage than on, for it appeared, despite a
healthy exterior, she was racked with torments arising from
an ailment described as “my neuralgia.” She spoke of her
neuralgia as others might say “My Mother.” It was indeed
her most cherished possession, and only through the
good offices of smelling-salts and aspirin was she able to
encompass the calls made upon her artistry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet, having made the acquaintance of the young
lady and her neuralgia, and being attracted by neither,
sought for someone to talk with during his long waits. In
so doing he espied Miss Mornice June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice was absurdly pretty. She had big black-lashed
eyes and a mass of whitey-gold fluffy hair. She played the
part of the Player Queen, and held sway over the hearts of
the small-part young gentlemen and those engaged as “extras.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gathered about her in the wings and sought the favour
of her smile. Neither did they seek in vain, for Mornice
had a quality of responsiveness that caused all who came
in contact with her to believe themselves vital to her well-being.
Did they come with jests, her laughter was light-hearted
and unstinted; did they come in sorrow, she was
quick to sympathise, and real tears would moisten her
lashes. An extremely sensitive person was Mornice, who
answered every vibration about her—be it grave or gay.
Not in mood alone but in outline, her entire being seemed
to impregnate itself with the spirit of the moment. She
would break off suddenly in the merriest laugh to respond to
a bar of music wailing pathetically from a hidden violin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just listen! Isn’t it wonderful!” she would say, transformed
into a picture of rapt adoration. Then in a second
she was back again to her faun-like merriment, exchanging
jokes that a properly brought up young lady would have
failed to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is the little lady yonder?” Eliphalet asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Helen Winter threw a flickering glance in the direction
of his gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>really</span> couldn’t tell you, <span class='it'>dear</span> Mr. Cardomay, for I
don’t know. A nice little thing, no doubt, but hardly a
lady. She gives me the impression of being on the stage
for the purpose of earning a living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was too subtle for Eliphalet, and he asked for an
explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean she has no people—no money. She acts for a
livelihood. Of course that is purely a surmise, but I am
sure I am right. The stage is full of young girls who are
trying to earn their living. It is very sad, when one comes
to think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being herself a dweller in Park Street, with no real occasion
to act, Miss Winter was one of the rapidly increasing
class who make it impossible for the really needy to find
employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was blissfully ignorant of the methods London
managers had begun to use. He did not know that it had
become quite <span class='it'>de rigueur</span> to engage society ladies to play
leading parts, irrespective of talent and merely for the sake
of the smart friends they attracted. It is the Box Office
that counts, first, last and always. Remember that, some of
you clever young ladies, before you abandon the typewriter
or the comfortable certainty of the Insurance Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me,” he said, “that stands to her credit. She strikes
me as a most charming little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quite—quite, <span class='it'>dear</span> Mr. Cardomay, but provincial—very,
very provincial.” And having delivered this two-edged
thrust, she sailed away to pastures new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Eliphalet asked the same question of Polonius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornice June, her name is. Something in her, I fancy.
Forget who told me she’s been earning her living since she
was fourteen. Her people were a bad lot—deserted her—so
they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet did not need to introduce himself, for the very
next day Mornice marched up and gave him a cheery smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind if I talk?” she said. “You look so homish
to me. I can’t get on with these London people a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made room for her on the roll of carpet, and she sat
beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, my dear,” he answered, “you seem to be very popular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With those silly boys, yes! But even they are different.
I say, I’m sure you know all about playing in Shakespeare.
I do wish you’d be an absolute dear, and hear me my lines.
I’m certain I shall get a fearful ‘bird’ from his Nibs.” (His
Nibs was her name for the eminent producer.) “It’s the
blank verse that does me. I’ve never tackled verse before,
except ‘I am Lily, called the Flowers’ Queen, the goodest,
sweetest fairy ever seen.’ You know—you flip up through
a star trap and get it off your chest, where the white limes
meet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She delivered the cheap couplet with perfect mimicry of
pantomime style, then clapped her hands and laughed gaily.
Eliphalet caught the infection of her spirit, and laughed too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will be a dear, and help me, won’t you?” she
appealed, picking a speck of fluff from the knee of his trousers.
“I say, you didn’t brush yourself very carefully this
morning, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stand corrected,” said Eliphalet; “but my dresser is
away on his holiday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you married, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—not now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice’s face became serious at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor dear, I am so sorry. Is she——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet took the book from her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said, “let us hear those lines. We will go
down this corridor, where we shall be undisturbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a rule, when you hold the book for someone who is
almost a stranger they are anxious and awkward, but it
was not so with Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just here where she enters with the Player King.
There! Got it? Right-o.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a second she flung herself into the spirit of the scene.
Gesture, voice and feature were alike unchained to the
emergency of the situation. At the right moment she
dropped to her knees and with outstretched arms poured
forth the protestations of undying fidelity with ringing
vibrations of emotion. When she had finished, she sprang
to her feet and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! that’s the best I can do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was amazed. Never before had he seen anyone
more liberally endowed with natural ability. And yet he
knew this ability was misguided—that Mornice June suffered
from a fatal facility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spontaneous ease of obtaining effects is perhaps the most
dangerous asset an artist may possess. You will find it
in legions of draughtsmen, who will dash off what is
seemingly the cleverest sketch and actually a mere tangle
of inaccuracy—wrong in every line and detail. They are
born with a box of tricks—any one of which may be drawn
from its docket at a second’s notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reach-me-down art—and as unlike the real thing as a
city tailor’s ready-for-wear garments to the creations of a
Savile Row expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was beyond Eliphalet Cardomay’s skill to point out
the fundamental fault in the girl’s acting, and it was beyond
his skill to indicate the fortune to which her facile skill
directed her. Had one of those wise and energetic gentlemen
been present, those gentlemen who project their three-reel
productions upon a white screen and who speak of “Close-ups,”
“Eyes that register well,” “Panoraming the Camera,”
and so forth, he would have recognised at once the great
future awaiting Miss Mornice June in the broad estates of
Filmland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing but admiration,” said Eliphalet. “You
must have studied hard to do so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Studied! I just swotted up the lines, that’s all. How
does one study?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By considering the relative values of what one is saying
and inflecting the lines accordingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I should never be able to do that. I just get a
thing, or I don’t get it. But d’you really think it’ll do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine it will do more than well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are a dear! I was sure you’d give me the
‘bird.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me: you have been on the stage for some long
while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um. Donkeys’ years; but I’m thinking of chucking it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giving it up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; for the ‘movies.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was aghast. To him the Cinema was a very
degrading profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, my dear,” he said, “you would find that a very
poor alternative to our beautiful art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I love the ‘movies,’ and I’m sure I should be able
to blink myself to fame. I can cry like old Billy-oh when
I want to—and the wet-lash stunt is half the battle,
y’know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then one of her many admirers came down the corridor.
He was a smooth-haired, self-satisfied looking fellow,
who played the Second Player.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been looking everywhere for you,” he said. “We
shall have to go on in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet moved away and left them together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a rotter, Morny, to talk to that old blighter
and leave me in the lurch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a duck,” said Mornice, “and I love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you love everyone except me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darling,” she exclaimed with outstretched arms, “I love
you to distraction. Without you the world would be a
desert track, or tract, whichever it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then for God’s sake give me a kiss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice considered the proposition in pouting perplexity.
Then she laughed and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be such a stupid little fool, Ken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always say that when I come to the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avoid the point then, darling, and you won’t get your
pretty little puds pricked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, will you come out to lunch with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I—will I? No. I won’t, but I’ll come to tea
instead, and pay my own share.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you let me kiss you? I’m in deadly earnest,
Morny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re in deadly earnest you shall kiss me. Oh, but
not now. You shall kiss me on the back of the ear when
it comes to the cue for the kiss in our scene.” And so
saying, she ducked her head and bolted down the corridor
as fast as she could run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the fortnight of rehearsals Eliphalet saw a great
deal of Mornice, and they became inseparable friends. She
told him her name was really Alice May, but she couldn’t
endure Alice, so had achieved Mornice from the deeps of
her imagination. She had elected the riper month of June
instead of May because it sounded jollier after Mornice.
Of her people she scarcely ever spoke. Once, in the course
of conversation, she chanced to remark:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, he did a vamoose—like mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is a ‘vamoose’?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you skip off and leave everything to look after
itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is what happened with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Umps! I’ve been on my own since I wore pigtails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was silent, thinking of the risks to which this
child must have been exposed in her struggle for a living.
Intuitively she read his thoughts, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can look after myself, though. Don’t you worry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite confident of that,” he replied. Then, after
a slight hesitancy, “But aren’t you a shade unwise to encourage
the admiration of all these young men? That Mr.
Kenneth Luke, for instance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Ken’s all right. He went to Oxford College, so he
ought to know how to behave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet smiled and shook his head dubiously. It seemed
to him that her reasoning was not quite conclusive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To tell the truth, Master Kenneth had been a little too
importunate of late, and Mornice had been considering the
advisability of “choking him off.” However, since her one
scene had to be played with him, she had thought it better
to keep on friendly terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay was more than pleased with the
notices the press gave him after the first night. “A rendering
full of the best traditions of Shakespeare,” said one.
“Mr. Cardomay’s beautiful voice was heard to advantage,”
said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gratifying to hear his “beautiful voice” spoken of
as though the whole world knew of its existence. He began
to regain some of the confidence lost after his last London
appearance. He fell to wondering what they would have
said had he appeared as Hamlet instead of the Ghost, and
concluded, erroneously, the papers would have been equally
flattering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never played Hamlet, and the idea of doing so
on some future tour possessed him. Little Mornice June
should be given the part of Ophelia, and would certainly
outshine the neuralgic young lady in her rendering. All
she needed was guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had quite made up his mind to engage Mornice
on a long contract, not only for her talent, but because
he could not endure the thought of losing sight of her.
Somehow she filled an empty space in his heart that long
had craved for a tenant. It is good for a man to have some
interests in life outside his work, and he had none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in Mornice that awoke a queer
familiarity with another episode of his life, but when he
tried to place the impression it would not develop. Was it
perhaps with scatter-brained little Eunice Terry, whom he
had disillusioned about the stage? No! For beyond the
“Nice” at the ends of their Christian names there was little
enough semblance. Mornice had her head screwed on the
right way, whereas Eunice had nearly had hers screwed off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning a rehearsal had been called for some minor
alterations, and Eliphalet was sitting with his back against
a scene-flat, when he heard Mornice’s voice on the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Ken,” she was saying. “Oh, dear, what a sad and
gloomy face!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know how to cure it,” came the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? I only seem to make it worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true. You’re playing with me, Morny, and I’ve
had enough of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’re too old to play, go and sit in the corner
with a book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake chuck fooling. After all, you can’t
afford to turn me down like this, and I’m not the chap to
put up with it for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a graceless speech, and Eliphalet was astonished
at the girl’s answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You old silly, I don’t want to turn you down. I’d like
you to be happy as the rest are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, make me happy, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I will—if I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can! Look here, Morny; come and have supper
with me after the show to-night.” She did not reply, and
he went on: “Why, hang it, you must have been out to
supper scores of times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have—scores and scores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come, then?” There was more than eagerness
in his tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well, I suppose. Very well, then—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last! And that’s a bargain, isn’t it? There’s no
going back now? Where would you like to go? Cecil?—Savoy?
Just say, and I’ll ring up for a room at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A room! What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shan’t want to be disturbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shan’t we? Now look here, Ken; if I come to supper
with you we sup in the main restaurant, or not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I know all about that. You can safely leave
the arrangements to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right; I will. And I’ll leave you the supper, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve taken a very intense dislike to you. I think you
are an absolute low little rotter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet, on the other side of the piece of scenery, murmured
a prayer of thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do?” said Kenneth. “Well, if that’s so, you won’t
be disappointed. I may not be great shakes in the company,
but I can promise to make it none too pleasant a
place for you—unless you say you are sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all very ill-conditioned and childish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only thing I’m sorry about,” said Mornice, “is
that I didn’t smack your face days ago.” She marched
off, the picture of outraged dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eliphalet, as a student of nature, reflected that the
young man had received a more valuable lesson than all his
’Varsity training had provided, and, when the rancour had
abated, would profit very greatly therefrom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is always disappointing when one’s opinions prove to
be at fault. Possibly this in some measure added to Eliphalet’s
cold fury at what took place that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had gone down earlier than usual and was standing in
the wings, watching the Play Scene. Mornice and Kenneth
Luke as the Player King and Queen, with arms interlaced,
came on to the stage within the stage and began to speak
their lines, and there followed the most paltry piece of
meanness Eliphalet had ever beheld. A deliberate effort to
“queer” a fellow-player.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seemingly Kenneth Luke had profited nothing by his
lesson of the morning and was determined to take it out of
his mentor by the unkindest method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ended his first speech with so inconclusive an inflection
that it was well-nigh impossible for her to speak her lines.
Not satisfied with this, he introduced long pauses in the
wrong places and when she, believing he had forgotten his
part, began to speak, he spoke also, with the result that
the words jumbled together unintelligibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice did her best, but had lost the thread of the scene
and broke down. So Kenneth prompted her audibly, and
no sooner had she started than he essayed to “queer” her
afresh. But that was not all, for when, in the course of
the scene, he lay down for his afternoon repose, or “secure
hour,” he contrived to lie upon the train of her gown.
Certainly he did it very discreetly, and none but Eliphalet
saw. It appeared from the front to be mere carelessness
when Mornice, in backing from the stage, stumbled, tried
to recover herself and fell noisily down the rostrum steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of a roar of laughter in that part of the play
can be imagined. The act, in the vulgar parlance, was
“dished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even through his make-up of ghostly green Eliphalet
Cardomay went quite purple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To trifle with one’s art was to him an unforgivable
offence—but when that trifling was done in a Shakespearian
production, a London theatre, and as a piece of sheer malice
against a young girl——!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The muscles of his hands knotted convulsively. This was
a matter that could be dealt with in only one way. He
made a movement toward the back of the stage, then
checked himself. He would be wanted for his last scene
in a moment. He must wait until after that, and then——!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be feared that Eliphalet Cardomay’s countenance
did not wear that expression of seraphic benignity it should
when he appeared behind the gauzy curtain and Hamlet
spoke the lines, “Look here upon this picture and on this.”
He contrived to impart the full measure of appeal into the
final words, “Speak to her, Hamlet,” then hurried from the
stage, stripping off his draperies and breathing through the
nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the first dressing-room landing Mornice was standing,
and before her, looking very different from his usual placid
self, was Mr. Winslow Dawson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sort of thing may do for the provinces,” he was
saying, “but it won’t do in the Mall Theatre. I have never
seen such an exhibition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t forget my cue,” said Mornice pathetically.
“Really and truly, I didn’t—and it wasn’t my fault I
fell down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dawson made an impatient gesture with his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Luke,” he said. Kenneth Luke stepped out of the
shadows, “you play the scene together—what have you to
say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well. I certainly noticed Miss June seemed rather all
over the place, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One minute,” said Eliphalet, steering into the middle
of the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dawson turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are rather busy,” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so am I,” said Eliphalet, “and my business won’t
wait.” Then, addressing Kenneth Luke, “Now, you—put
up your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put them up. I’m going to give you a thrashing. Do
you understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” replied Kenneth insolently. “And what
the devil are you interfering for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the pleasure of doing that,” said Eliphalet, and hit
him with surprising vigour on the end of the nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn!” roared the youngster, and drew back his arm
with intention of countering. But somehow it entangled
in his cloak and before he had freed it, Eliphalet had
pranced in and rained upon him a veritable tornado of
blows. More by luck than judgment one of them took
Kenneth on the point of the jaw, and put him to sleep
behind a curtain of falling stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say! whatever is all this about?” exclaimed Mr.
Dawson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A—piece of—just retribution and N-nemesis. Tell him,
my dear—I—I’m——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then very gracefully, as he was graceful in all things,
Eliphalet Cardomay tottered and collapsed across the body
of his prostrate foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not a wise proceeding for a man on the wrong side
of sixty to engage in a rough-and-tumble. The results are
apt to produce cardiac disturbances. The doctor, who was
called in, said afterwards there was a time when he doubted
whether Mr. Cardomay’s heart was equal to the task of
adjusting itself. Certainly the old actor was in a sorry way
when he was placed in Mr. Deansgate’s private brougham
and driven off to Camden Town under the guardianship of
a very anxious Mornice. She had explained how the circumstances
came about, and Mr. Deansgate sent a polite
request to Kenneth Luke to call at his office before leaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this interview was significantly betrayed by
the presence of Kenneth Luke’s “card” in the following
Thursday’s issue of the <span class='it'>Daily Telegraph</span>, with the words
“At Liberty” following his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice and the landlady put Eliphalet to bed and tucked
him in as though he were a child. He complained of being
thirsty and very tired, and hardly seemed aware of his
surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t leave him to-night,” whispered Mornice. “Perhaps
you’d give me a comfy chair, Ma dear, then I can
watch restfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the good Mrs. Albion liked being addressed as
“Ma dear,” she produced her best armchair (a forbidding
affair of varnished walnut, American cloth and brass-headed
nails), and set it beside the bed. She also put a match to
the fire and, on the principle of “If you’re not going to
sleep, you must eat,” cooked up “a bit o’ supper.” She
did not leave the room until satisfied that Mornice had
done justice to the grilled herring and jug of hot coffee.
Then she gave her a “nice” kiss and a whispered good night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice lowered the gas, and, taking Eliphalet’s hand,
sat beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Old Card was very restless, and rambled in his mind
and speech. Fragments of disjointed sentences and long
out-of-use quotations came from his lips. Once he snatched
away his hand and cried “Put them up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very gently Mornice soothed him and regained his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I was right—a blackguard,” muttered Eliphalet.
“And she little more than a child—clever—dear child! With
a little training, a little care—‘Have you a daughter? Let
her not walk in the sun.’ I’ve no daughter—no child—nothing.
That’s so, old boy; that’s so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ssh!” whispered Mornice. “You must go to sleep. Ssh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s that?” He spoke in a startled tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s me—Mornice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Me, Mornice’—No—‘I,’ Mornice, ‘I’—a little training—a
little guidance.” His voice trailed away into silence.
When next he spoke it was to ask:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three at night—and that was a woman’s voice, I don’t
understand. Who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three o’clock at night—No, not Mornice—you’re
Blanche—poor old Blanche! And yet so much seems to
have happened since—and Blanche—I don’t know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice started violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you call me Blanche?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quick sound of her voice roused the old man from
his wanderings, for he turned, rose on his elbow, and looked
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, my dear?” he said. “Why are you
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been ill,” she replied. “Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, yes, I remember now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” she begged. “A moment ago you called me
Blanche.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did!—good God, yes! That’s where the resemblance
lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who were you speaking of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche Cannon. Before you were born she was my
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she is my mother. Then am I——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had taken her hands and was looking at her
with wide-opened eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How I wish you were!” he said. “But you came after,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Mornice very positively but very tenderly,
“whether I am, or whether I’m not, whether you like it
or whether you don’t, I’m going to be your daughter—See!”
And she kissed him as a daughter should.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the theatre a week later the Lady of the Lorgnettes
addressed She of the Neuralgia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My <span class='it'>dear</span>,” she said. “Have you heard the news? <span class='it'>That</span>
Mr. Cardomay has taken <span class='it'>that</span> Miss Something-or-other
June to live with him. <span class='it'>Really</span>, it is extraordinary what
these <span class='it'>stage</span> people will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And She of the Neuralgia was constrained to take two
aspirins in rapid succession to recover from the tidings,
while the Lady of the Lorgnettes turned aside to congratulate
<span class='it'>that</span> Mr. Cardomay on his speedy recovery.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A REVERSIBLE FAVOUR</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A certain old actor, whose spirit had passed above
the flies, once remarked, referring to “Hamlet,” “This
delightful profession of ours is ruined by perennial productions
of that most gloomy play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such an observation is, of course, indefensible, nevertheless
the magnetic charms of “Hamlet” are, to a certain
extent, margined. Without exception it delights the actor
who plays the title-rôle, and almost without exception it
fails to delight those members of the cast who play the
minor parts. Another section of the dramatic world who
eye this drama askance are those indispensable gentlemen
whose money is reposed in theatrical enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A syndicate, as a rule, is composed of unemotional persons,
whose love of art is subordinated to a love of profit,
and with this aim in view they are apt to rebel against the
devotion of their capital to presentations of Shakespearian
masterpieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, in fact, was what occurred when Eliphalet Cardomay
gravely announced this intention at the Round Table of his
Supporters. His appearance in town in the character of
The Ghost inspired the idea, and he had thought it over
very carefully and decided it was good. Little Mornice
June was to appear as Ophelia—a revival of “The Night
Cry” would be postponed, and it only remained to impart
his intentions to the four commercial gentlemen who composed
his syndicate and receive their sanction and blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will agree,” he said, “to an actor of my calibre a
career cannot be regarded as complete if he has failed to
appear as the Moody Dane. We have been in the best
accord in our past dealings, and I am confident of your
approval in this matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while no one spoke. Mr. Albert Shingle, owner of
a large Drapery Emporium, with branches in several Midland
towns, looked furtively at Mr. Thomas Combermare,
dealer in dry-goods. But Mr. Combermare only picked his
teeth with a tram-ticket and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know so much,” said Mr. Shingle, at last,
expanding his globular waistcoat. “What do you say, Mr.
Wardluke?” The gentleman appealed to was a retired
doctor, who had done extremely well by opening small
surgeries in the poorer parts of Bradford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to agree with Mr. Cardomay,” he said, “for,
on the whole, he has done extremely well by us—but—well—‘Hamlet.’
You see what I mean? One must consider
the public.” He put a pencil in his ear, stethoscope fashion,
as though seeking to learn how the heart-beats of the
multitude responded to so extreme a test.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am all against it—all against it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an angular little man who spoke. His name was
Wilfred Wilfur, and he had inherited more money than
his talents would have earned. His own opinions he valued
highly, and was alone in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are here to make money—make it, Mr. Cardomay,
make money—not to lose. Now I, personally—and I suppose
I count—I’m one of the public, you know—I don’t
like ‘Hamlet.’ I’ve never read it—never seen it—and I
don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am suggesting,” said Eliphalet, patiently, “that in
this case you consult my views rather than your own. On
examining past records I find you have never made less
than eight per cent. each year on the capital I have controlled;
in many cases far more. This justifies me, I think,
in demanding a certain latitude of action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not business, Cardomay,” said Mr. Shingle.
“That’s sentiment, that is, and sentiment’s no good. I put
you a plain straightforward question. Which’d make most
money—‘Hamlet’ or ‘The Night Cry?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money is not the only consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is with us—it is with us,” chirped Mr. Wilfur excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet fidgeted with his cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Financially, in all probability, ‘The Night Cry’ would
show better receipts, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Then that settles it—we will put up ‘The
Night Cry.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet compressed his lips and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not settled so easily,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for the first time in their mutual association there
was a scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was decided if Eliphalet desired to retain their services
he must adjust his views to theirs. He, as a counter, produced
precisely the same terms, and the result was a
lock-out. Art <span class='it'>versus</span> Commerce. The meeting broke up
with generally distributed feelings of grievance and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay took some rooms in Trafford Park
and sat down to wait until such a time as they should
realise their folly and withdraw the opposition to his
demands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was never really happy when not working, and even
the pleasant companionship of Mornice failed to dispel the
gloom of the days that followed. They were both bitterly
disappointed. He at the lack of faith shown by his syndicate,
and she at losing her first chance of a big part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had hurt Eliphalet more than he believed possible to
break the news to her after the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, never mind,” she had said. “I should have been
very dud as Ophelia. Anyway, I shall be in ‘The Night
Cry,’ shan’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he told her “The Night Cry” was indefinitely
postponed, her distress was evident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice was wholly centred in getting on, and sitting
idle in the Trafford Park lodgings was almost more than
she could endure. Very discreetly she hinted at being
allowed to try for a Cinema engagement to fill in, but on
that subject Eliphalet was severe in his disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cinematograph acting is not art,” he would say. “Trust
me, and sooner or later you shall have your chance. My
syndicate will come to their senses before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the weeks dragged by, but no word was received
from Messrs. Shingle, Wardluke, Wilfur and Combermare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made an effort to find a new syndicate, but oddly
enough no one rose to the fly. Then Mornice approached
the subject again on different lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all nonsense,” she said. “I’m costing you a fearful
lot.” (This was not strictly true, for their weekly bills
rarely exceeded two pounds.) “And there’s not the slightest
reason why I should. Do let me try and get a teeny part in
a film. There are two companies in Manchester, now, and
if you give me an introduction I’m sure they’d have me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet refused, but worried over the matter exceedingly.
After all, he had promised to help her, and instead he had
done nothing beyond the entertainment of his own society
and the provision of a very bread-and-butter existence. He
reflected that she must be considering herself worse off now
than before they had met, and was probably reproaching
the impetuosity that led her to play the part of daughter
to an old man. It was not fair she should be pilloried on
his account. So he lay awake at night and sought for a
solution and when he found a way to make good his promise
he set about it with characteristic zeal. From the bottom of
a theatrical basket he produced a bundle of old plays—Veterans
of the Road, with expired copyrights. These he
sorted over, collected half-a-dozen, and dropped them into
Mornice’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read them carefully,” he said, “and tell me which one
you would like to play the most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In great excitement Mornice read them all, and decided
on a play of the “Sweet Nancy” order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! You shall play it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next move was to secure a few bookings from small
Number 2 towns. This proved rather difficult, since he
offered old material and an unknown cast, but by accepting
very low terms the dates were secured. A company was
engaged, some stock scenery hired, and three weeks later
Miss Mornice June, flushed and triumphant, was starring
in the “Smalls,” in a comedy “Presented by Mr. Eliphalet
Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presented was an appropriate word, since the receipts
were so infinitesimal that it cost Eliphalet about fifteen
pounds a week to keep the tour running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he was earning no salary at the time, he moved to a
humbler lodging off the Palatine Road, and there continued
the silent and unsuccessful freezing out of his syndicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no real occasion for Eliphalet to economise to
the extent he was doing, for his banking account showed
a comfortable credit (fruit of many years’ saving). To do
so, however, was no great privation, for the provincial actor
knows better than any other man how to live, and live well,
on nothing a week. Better circumstances had brought little
change in Eliphalet Cardomay’s mode of life. Joints appeared
on the table with great frequency, perhaps, and he
did not deny himself a dish of crumpets when the bell of
the muffin-man sounded in the street. But these little extras
he now excised, and gave further outward evidence of
poverty by walking the streets with melancholy mien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He missed his Art and missed Mornice, and altogether
he was ill-content. The delights of prominence so obsessed
Miss Mornice that letter-writing, after the first week, showed
a pathetic decline. He had to satisfy himself with postcards
of which “Having a lovely time—You are a dear” was a
fair sample.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day when meandering down Oxford Road, Eliphalet
was heartily accosted by another old actor of the name
Sefton Bulmore. Bulmore had once been a popular comedian,
but had lost much of his hold upon the public. After
eking out a precarious existence with special performances
and short tours, he had the good fortune to obtain some
fairly regular work with Eastlake’s Exclusive Cinema Company,
and had given them satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a breezy, go-as-you-please old fellow, who would
borrow a shilling or lend you a pound with equal good-nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Cardomay! Dear old boy, old man—how’s
things?” he hailed. “You don’t look too grand. Haven’t
seen your poster about lately. Where are you showing
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not, at the moment,” replied Eliphalet. “But
won’t you step along and take a cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they walked toward the lodging Sefton Bulmore did
most of the talking, but this did not prevent him from casting
sidelong glances at his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must have come a cropper somehow,” he reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of Eliphalet’s very humble apartment and the
modest fare offered strengthened this impression. Discreetly
as possible he tried to discover how matters stood, but his
masked inquiries failed to produce the required information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be getting along,” he said at last, with a
hearty hand-shake. As he touched the handle of the door
an idea flashed into his brain, and he turned:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just occurred to me—I’ve come out without any ready.
You might lend me a couple of ten shillings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet hesitated. “I haven’t so much on me,” he
answered, “but I daresay——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord love you, I don’t want it—only a joke—pulling
your leg, that’s all. Ha! Well! Must be going, old man.
Bye-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sefton Bulmore had learnt what he wanted to know—or
thought he had. As he walked down the street he
muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tch, tch! Bad business! Poor old Card! Tch-tch.
Getting old—losing ground—hipped—stony!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the stage, more perhaps than in any other calling,
there exists a wonderful unity and fellowship. You will
never appeal in vain for help for one player to another.
The hat that goes round empty is always filled before
returning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sefton Bulmore worried over Eliphalet Cardomay all
night, and the liberal supply of whisky he absorbed failed
to dispel his anxieties. It would be no good offering money,
even if he had it to offer, for the Old Card was far too
proud to accept charity. He would have to devise some
means of helping him, and, by hook or by crook, he meant to
do so. The opportunity arose sooner than he expected, for
the very next morning brought an offer by post from
Eastlake’s Exclusives of a long part in a Three-Reel Drama,
and the terms proposed were thirty guineas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Sefton Bulmore knew that his prayer had been
answered, and rejoiced. He donned his brightest clothes,
swallowed a hasty Guinness, and sallied forth to interview
Mr. Eastlake of the Movies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, Bulmore!” that gentleman greeted him. “So you
got our letter, eh? Going to accept?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” replied Bulmore, “very sorry, old boy, but I
can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the trouble? Terms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Busy, old man; busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all rot. You’re just the man I want, and I don’t
know where to find another if you turn us down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn you down! Wouldn’t do it. Matter of fact, I
am making you a present by refusing. ’Cause I can put
you on to a fine proposition straight away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and fix details <span class='it'>ac dum</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s have it,” said Eastlake a shade warily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sefton Bulmore cast a suspicious eye round the office,
as though about to expose a secret of awful moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you say to Eliphalet Cardomay?”—he had
dropped his voice to a penetrating whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eliphalet Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never heard of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never—what? Come, come, old man, old boy, that’s
too rich. But you can’t be born yet if you haven’t heard
of <span class='it'>him</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may have heard the name, but not in our line of
business. What about him, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this—I can—get—him—to—play—the—part. Now
then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Eastlake did not appear half so impressed as he
should have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!” he remarked. “Would he be any use?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulmore cast his eyes ceiling-ward in mute despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use! Now look here, old boy, I tell you frankly, if
you are going to play round with the notion I shall call
it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s he doing now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Resting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At liberty—eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, resting; and there’s a big difference between the
two. Resting means you are not acting because you don’t
want to act. At liberty means you want to act, and would
at any price, but can’t. Got it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Well, send him along, and I’ll look him over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand—you don’t know what you’re
saying, old man. Why, he wouldn’t walk to the end of the
street to look for jobs, for the simple reason that half the
town is coming his way to offer ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like that, eh? Well, I suppose I must take your word,
Bulmore, and risk it. For your sake I hope he doesn’t let
us down, that’s all. What’s he like, now—is he funny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulmore stretched his imagination to the fullest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should just hear them shriek at him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And about terms? Would he take a bit less?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the one difficulty, old man. I mentioned what
you’d said, but he held out that thirty-five guineas was the
lowest he’d accept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s the highest we’d pay. Tell him that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll let it go at thirty-five, and if you’ve a sheet
of paper handy I’ll sign an acceptance form on his behalf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sefton Bulmore’s cherrywood cane, which he spun in his
hand as he went whistling down the street, was a peril to
the neighbourhood. He did not allow himself to be oppressed
in the smallest degree that he had turned over to
his friend a sum of money of which he was in great personal
need. He felt himself amply repaid by having brought
the interview to so successful a conclusion. Great is the
balm descending upon him that giveth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without losing any time he hastened to inform his old
colleague of the news, and with truly dramatic sense did
not dull the point by approaching it too directly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Eliphalet Cardomay taking a modest luncheon,
and sat down to join him without waiting for an invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t seem right to see you out of harness,” he began,
his mouth well filled with cheese and pickles. “What’s
more, I can’t believe it agrees with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One feels the difference, of course,” Eliphalet confessed.
“However, it is my own choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulmore took this statement as a piece of pardonable
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, I wonder you don’t do something as a fill-in. Now,
there’s quite a decent income waiting to be picked up with
the Cinema, y’know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Cinema!” Eliphalet’s eyebrows arched disapprovingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it. Growing concern, old man, getting a bigger
hold on the public every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mushroom season is a short one,” commented
Eliphalet drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they both do best in the dark,” said Bulmore,
with a laugh. “But the Cinema has come to stay, laddie,
mark my words; and it’s up to you and me to have a dip
in the pie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay rose and assumed a position of
importance by the fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is up to you and me, and all those who treasure the
traditions of our noble calling, to manifest our disapproval
of this mechanical device for—what shall I say?—for potting
our artistry, by leaving it severely alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulmore, who was expecting his old friend to embrace
the opportunity he had come to offer, was wholly unprepared
for so hostile an attitude. He kicked himself, metaphorically,
for introducing the subject in this roundabout
way instead of walking straight up and saying, “You’re
broke, old man; here’s a job for you.” But having chosen
his means he had no other course but to continue on the
lines of his beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” he said. “Still, there are times when we must
tone down our ideals a bit and take what pickings lie around.
Matter of fact, I was talking to Eastlake this morning—Eastlake’s
Exclusives, y’know—and he gave me to understand
he’d be very glad of your services.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to disappoint the gentleman, Bulmore, but
my views on this subject are too pronounced to allow me
to relax them on his account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was pride with a vengeance, thought Bulmore, and
he stumbled badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money’s good,” he said. “Thirty-five pounds for two
weeks’ work can’t be sneezed at, y’know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I allowed money to influence me,” responded Eliphalet,
“I would never be able to hold up my head again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—Well! I mean—I hardly know what to say next,
old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say nothing. We have so many topics in common, it
is a pity to pursue one in which we are at variance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulmore ran his fingers through his thin hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this way, old man,” he said. “You—you’d be doing
me a real favour by accepting this shop—a real favour to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me asking, but how can that be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was clearly a moment for invention, and Bulmore
wrestled with his ingenuity before answering, and finally
produced:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I want to make a favourable impression with
the firm. If they saw I was a friend of yours, it’ud do me
a piece of good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not ask for the part yourself?” suggested
Eliphalet, by no means displeased with the compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, but they won’t have me. They are dead-set on
you, and no one else will do. Now, as a pal——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Eliphalet firmly; “it is asking too much
of friendship. Please let us drop the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Bulmore played his last card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you refuse, you’ll do for me absolutely, because—well,
I—I made ’em a solemn promise in your name that
you’d take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, old man—and signed a contract for you into the
bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Eliphalet’s indignation was too great for
expression. He took several turns up and down the little
room, tossing his head and ejaculating “tchas” of displeasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad! Too bad altogether. After all these years,
Bulmore! You should have known me better! To prostitute
my art in this way! Too—too bad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done it now,” muttered Bulmore, with hanging
head. “And I suppose you’ll do me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was pathos in every line of the little man’s figure,
for he could act very realistically when he chose. Eliphalet
saw, and could not ignore, the silent appeal. With an
effort he walked over and laid a hand on the bent shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you should know me better than to think that,”
he said. “I never go back on my friends, whatever the cost.
You may tell Mr. Eastlake I am pleased to accept his offer.
And now let us say no more about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Bulmore walked down the street there was no swinging
cane to mark the gaiety of his mood. He felt bruised and
disappointed. The affair had turned out so differently from
expectations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sefton Bulmore, in fact, was suffering, as so many others
have suffered, from doing a good turn without positively
labelling it as a good turn beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have liked him to have been pleased,” he
murmured. “But he’ll earn the money, and that’s what
matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The open doors of the Lion lured him to enter. In the
saloon he met an acquaintance, and touched him for ten
bob and a cigar.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are peculiar qualities required in film-acting to
obtain good results. Being denied speech as a means of
expression, you are forced to seek other alternatives. Facial
expression and gesture will not suffice. There remains but
one solution—you must think right. Do this, or, in other
words, let your thoughts be in accord with the scene you
are required to play, and you will find automatically all the
emotions will have portrayed themselves. Also you must
have a good nerve, for to many the rotation of the operator’s
hand and the precise tick-tick-tick of the camera
produce an even more disconcerting effect than does a first-night
audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you are fearless, clear-brained and receptive, put on
your best bib and tucker, and sally forth to Wardour
Street, the G.H.Q. of Filmland, for there a fortune is
awaiting you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a certain extent Eliphalet Cardomay thought right,
and his actions were always graceful; but he could not
conquer embarrassment of the camera. His performance
was marred by nervousness, and nervousness shows with
alarming fidelity on the screen. From this cause many
promising scenes had to be re-taken again and again, and
the producer, an American who savoured of pistols and the
Wild West, danced in indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask you, Mr. Cardomay,” he implored, “not to look
at the camera as if it were loaded. We’re trying to get
stuff into the machine, and not out of it. Now, once again,
please. Ready, Cable? Go, then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The operator would start to turn, Eliphalet to enter, and
the producer to talk, all at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down stage a little, please. That’ll do. Take out your
penknife—cut the string so. Raise your chin—a little more,
more—don’t look at me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eliphalet would throw down the penknife and
exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really cannot act if you will talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop turning, Cable. There goes another eighty feet.
Now why in hell did you leave off? Pardon my language,
but oblige me with an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot act if you talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here to talk—wouldn’t be a film if I didn’t. How
can you hope to keep the audience from beating it unless
I put a bit of variety in your positions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your talking interferes with my acting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t want you to act. Want you to cut the string
of a parcel and put the knife back in your pocket. You
wouldn’t have straw down on the sidewalk before your
villa, if you were doing that at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was mortally offended, and only loyalty to his
old friend prevented him from throwing up the engagement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considering the ceaseless irritations he was subjected to,
his behaviour throughout was exemplary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the comic scenes he appeared at his worst.
Seeing no humour in them himself, he registered nothing
beyond the suggestion of outraged dignity upon the film.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Eastlake saw Eliphalet’s comedy—for he was
in the habit of having the day’s work projected for his
approval each evening on a miniature screen—he was exceeding
wroth. Consequently he visited the studio next
morning and engaged the old actor in conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me,” he said, “your comedy is not a strong
point. Now, Bulmore told me you could be screamingly
funny when you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny!” echoed Eliphalet. “I have never been funny
in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s what he told me, and on the strength of it
I made the engagement. Sorry to bother you, but if this
film is to be released, you really must whack a bit of fun
into your part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do my best,” said Eliphalet loftily. “But ‘every
tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not
gather figs, nor of a bramble-bush gather they grapes.’ ” And
having delivered this dictum, he bowed and walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is doubtful whether Eliphalet’s efforts to be funny
would have given amusement to a village idiot. He was
frankly at sea with the ridiculous—at sea in an unexplored
ocean, and his flounderings were pitiful to behold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mr. Eastlake and the producer held a conference and
decided it was useless to proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll burn the lot,” said Eastlake. “Pay him off and
start afresh. That fellow Bulmore fairly sold us a dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning Eliphalet was politely informed that his
services were no longer required. No reasons were given,
nor any reproaches made. Film companies conduct their
business on business lines. There is no “incompetent”
clause in their contracts. When a performer has failed to
give satisfaction, he is paid in full, and another is engaged.
Eliphalet received a cheque for thirty-five guineas, and a
polite “Good-day” from the cashier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was buttoning his coat in the hall he heard Mr.
Eastlake’s voice sounding through his office door:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Bulmore—and we are not likely to have any more
work for you either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why, old man? Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might ask you why—why you told us those wonderful
tales about your clever friend. He’s let us in for a couple
of thousand feet that aren’t worth the price of fixing salts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! That’s bad! I thought he’d be all right—straight
I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why turn him on to us if you wanted the job
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause; then Bulmore’s voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was dead broke, and I wanted to do him a good
turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At our expense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my own, old man, by the looks of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet waited for no more, but flushing for shame,
slipped out into the street and hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a favour of doing it,” he muttered. Bulmore’s
money in his pocket burnt like a hot coal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awaiting him at home was a statement of the week’s
account from the manager of Mornice’s tour. The expenses
were twenty-two pounds in excess of the takings. He also
received a postcard from Mornice saying she was dreadfully
miserable that the tour was finishing the following week,
but it would be lovely to see him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll never be happy unless she’s acting,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote some figures on the back of an envelope, figures
which showed that her tour had realised a loss of eighty
pounds. Eighty pounds. He had earned nothing for the
last ten weeks save—and he looked at the cheque for thirty-five
guineas—money defrauded from a friend, and ill-earned
at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no good,” he argued, his thoughts resting on
the cherished wish to play ‘Hamlet.’ “No good—and after
all, blessed is he that humbleth his pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he sat down to write, addressing the letter to Mr.
Shingles, Chairman of the Syndicate. A reply was received
two days later, and he duly entrained for Bradford to
attend the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reception was chilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have re-considered my views, gentlemen,” he said, “and
withdraw my proviso with regard to the ‘Hamlet’ production.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew we’d starve you out,” squeaked Mr. Wilfur,
rubbing his bony hands. “Oh, yes, money always counts—money
wins, money does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” said Eliphalet, thinking of Bulmore. “With
some men friendship stands on a higher plane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I may say, Cardomay, that you have strained
friendship almost to a breaking-point,” commented the obese
Mr. Shingles. “Here’s half the autumn gone, and nothing
done. Still, if you have come back admitting yourself to
be in fault—well—— But what do you say, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good harbouring ill-feeling. We may as well carry
on, but since we’ve lost so much time and all the best dates,
the question of reduced percentage asserts itself,” said Mr.
Wardluke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus the thin edge of the wedge implanted itself
daintily into the future fortunes of Eliphalet Cardomay.
When he left the meeting he had lost ground, and what
was left before him was perilously insecure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On arriving home he sent a letter to Bulmore asking him
to supper, and spent the time of waiting purchasing and
laying out a really sumptuous spread. In his breast-pocket
there was a bulge of banknotes, representing the cashing of
Mr. Eastlake’s cheque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha!” he cried when old Bulmore, looking rather
down and out, came into the room. “Here’s the man who
brought me luck. Congratulate me, my dear old fellow,
for I open again in my own management in a month’s
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tone rang with enthusiasm, and all through the meal
he held forth upon the advantageous terms he had arranged
with his syndicate and the big success forecasted for the
play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Sefton Bulmore could hardly fail to feel rather
out in the cold, but he did his best to reflect the cheerful
mood of his host. The effort was pathetically transparent,
however, as Eliphalet noted with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, and to tell you the truth, Bulmore, I was a
bit low. That thirty-five guineas you put me in the way
of earning was a godsend. But now! they can’t do enough—insisted
on my accepting a big advance.” And he
flourished a wad of notes before Bulmore’s hungry eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all the will in the world, the old fellow could not
help wishing his friend would be a trifle less arrogant about
his finances. It is a severe test on a man who has nothing
in his pockets to resist envying one who has so much,
especially when he knows that but for a flash of generosity
some of that money would have been his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay might not always have shown genius
in his portrayal of emotions, but he understood them very
thoroughly, notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eventually Bulmore could endure the ordeal no longer,
and rose to take his departure. At the hall door he halted
indecisively, shuffled his feet and cleared his throat a good
deal, but he said nothing. So Eliphalet took the bull by
the horns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am very grateful indeed,” he repeated for the
twentieth time, “and if there is the slightest thing I can do
for you by way of return, I shall take it as unfriendly if
you fail to name it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank ye,” said Bulmore huskily. “I won’t forget.” He
descended one step, then turned. “Matter of fact,” he
admitted with rather a dry tongue, “I am just a wee bit
short of ready at the moment, and a sovereign or two——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear old friend, I wouldn’t insult you with
such a loan. Here, take”—and he produced the roll of
notes—“take these. No, no; I insist—please. There! that’s
right. Not a word—I beg you. After all, we are friends,
and between friends—— But what a moon! Wonderful
night—wonderful night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old man!” said Bulmore, wringing his hand in silent
gratitude and sniffling suggestively. “Dear old man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some reason Eliphalet sniffed too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re a couple of fools, Bulmore,” he said, at last;
“a couple of old fools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, actors, laddie; actors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it—actors. Sometimes I think it is a very great
thing to be an actor. Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, tucking the money in his pocket, he shuffled down
the street.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DEAR DEPARTED</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>If Eliphalet Cardomay never pretended Mornice June was
his own daughter he certainly never checked her from
calling him Father, or any other such title her fancy devised.
A man on the very wrong side of sixty, who has
never been so called, finds the sound of that name comes
very sweetly to his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he met her at the station on her return from the
tour, she halloed “Father” from the carriage window, and
leapt into his arms before the train had stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually Eliphalet was a ceremonious man under the eye
of the public, but on this occasion he returned her embraces
with a warmth equal to her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me!” he said, as arm-in-arm, the gust of welcome
having subsided, they walked from the station. “Dear me!
I wouldn’t have believed I could be so happy and excited.
I haven’t been kissed on a railway platform since——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated. “Oh, a very long while ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts strayed back over a chasm of years, to the
time when this girl’s mother, in the first flights of their
courtship, embarrassed him grievously by the publicity of
her affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of your mother,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” replied Mornice, who was hoping for a more
spirited confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he went on, “when I see you, I sometimes
wish I had been a little more tolerant. It is a wonderful
possession—a child of one’s own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might not have liked me so well,” said Mornice
gaily. Her face took more serious lines. “I was only
fourteen when she cleared out and left me on my own—but
it wouldn’t have been any good—I can see that. She
wasn’t a bit nice, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a quality of frankness about Mornice. She
invariably spoke her mind. A bad mother was none the
better for being her own. Mrs. Harrington May, late Mrs.
Eliphalet Cardomay, <span class='it'>née</span> Blanche Cannon, was not a lady
to inspire affection in other than masculine hearts, and even
there not a quality to endure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you do not miss your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Eliphalet thoughtfully; “and no more do I.
Well, well; I have arranged with the syndicate—yes, I had
to climb down about playing ‘Hamlet,’ and now we are
going to put up ‘The Night Cry,’ after all. The cast is
engaged and we start rehearsing here this week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s fine,” said Mornice. Then with a shade of
nervousness, “And who have you got to do my part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yourself, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?—Oh, but, Pummy, I can’t. Didn’t I write and
tell you? Thought I had—at least, I didn’t think I had,
exactly, but I meant to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what?” Eliphalet looked genuinely startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Daddy fatherums, don’t—don’t look so serious,
please. It’s—I—— Well, I met a young man—a boy—a
gentleman—oh, yes, always the perfect gentleman. No,
but he’s a dear, really; I mean, he’s awfully nice and <span class='it'>very</span>
clever, and—— Well, I didn’t want to be a drag on you,
and you never actually told me you were going to open, so
I didn’t see how I could very well refuse—could I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet stopped dead, with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, what are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I knew you’d disapprove, and I knew if I waited
to ask you, you wouldn’t let me; so I took my courage in
both hands, shut my eyes, and said, ‘Yes.’ But it’s only
for six weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his tail-pocket Eliphalet drew a large silk handkerchief
and mopped his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is only for six weeks?” he managed to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you—this Cinema engagement, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said faintly. “If you don’t mind, we
will go into this dairy and take a glass of milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until they had seated themselves at the small marble-topped
table, with two china beakers of milk and some
sponge-cakes on white saucers before them, did he speak
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One should never mystify one’s audience: that is a first
principle in our profession. Remember it, my dear, and
you will save people from many unnecessary shocks. Now,
about this engagement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mornice told him how one Ronald Knight, who was
“really awfully nice,” had seen her playing at Colwyn Bay,
and had come round “after the show” with a most alluring
offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are a new firm, and, just think! they are going
to pay me a pound a day—and I’m to play lead in the
film. Oh, Daddy fatherums, I’m to play the Village Maid!”
And, kissing the tips of her fingers, she dabbed them on the
end of the old man’s nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking into consideration Eliphalet’s strong distaste for
the Cinema—a distaste rendered more poignant by his own
recent unsuccessful exploits before the camera—it is surprising
that he did not at once quash the whole idea. The
fact remains, however, that he did not. He knew in honesty
to his ideals he should have taken up a very severe
standpoint, but instead he caressed the end of his nose
lovingly, where the sense of the kiss she had dabbed upon
it still endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, well!” he said. “There is no better way of
learning a mistake than by experience—and that I am not
justified in denying you. But after the six weeks, Mornice,
you will return to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you darling, to let me!” she exclaimed, delightedly.
“And of course I’ll do whatever you say I must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed to ponder for a while, and presently said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it you called me a moment ago? Some quite
odd name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy fatherums?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was it—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like being called that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do,” he confessed, after the manner of an expert
tasting a rare wine. “I do. It is very foolish of me, no
doubt—idiotic—but I like it notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old man will do a great deal for a girl—that is
sufficiently obvious; and so, for that matter, will a young
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To avoid losing any of her society Eliphalet shifted the
scene of his rehearsals and all the cast to Chester, in which
town, on account of its historic surroundings, the film was
being taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His theatrical lodging-book showed no addresses of the
landladies of Chester, but Mornice promised to drop a card
to Ronald Knight to arrange rooms and meet them at the
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight, it subsequently appeared, was not the
manager of the film company, but the manager’s son. He
was a young man of dramatic enthusiasm and ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Mornice’s conversations he recurred with great frequency,
under such titles as Ron, Ronny, Spud, The Boy—or
Pyjams. (The latter being arrived at by a kind of
inverted reasoning, <span class='it'>sic</span>. Knight—Knightie—Nightie; and
since the masculine of nightie equals pyjamas, hence
Pyjams.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was somewhat hard put to it to recognise a
single personality under so many alternative names. He
gathered that Mr. Knight was well placed in the esteem of
his protégée, and on that account suffered mildly jealous
pangs. These he was not too subtle to betray—when
Mornice would tactfully remark:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy is frightfully anxious to meet you. He just
thrilled when I told him I was your sort-of-daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, that is very likely,” said Eliphalet, ironically;
but he was none the less pleased by these nosegays of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the whole cast of “The Night Cry” were entrained for
Chester, where in due course they arrived. Mr. Knight was
waiting on the platform, and sprang to open the door of
Eliphalet’s compartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s The Boy,” cried Mornice. “Now, Spud, be
polite, and shake hands with Mr. Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight was naturally polite, and did as he was
bid, with “It’s a very great pleasure to meet you, sir.”
While Mornice, in the background, gratuitously supplied,
“I call him Daddy fatherums, and sometimes Pummy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet frowned a little. An old man does not care
to have his pet name hung on the line for all to behold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s boasting,” said Ronald, with some neatness,
who, reversely, as a young man, was charmed to have been
called “Spud” in public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornice tells me she has asked you to find us some
accommodations,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I forgot to,” gasped Mornice, in instant contrition.
Then: “Hold out your hand, Morny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald laughed as she inflicted punishment upon herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a few addresses, Mr. Cardomay. Or perhaps
you will stay at the hotel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I prefer rooms—they are more homely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of addresses were written on the back of an
envelope (“No, not that one.” Eliphalet recognised
Mornice’s writing, and smiled), and armed with these, he
and she and their more portable assets climbed into a cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald was a shade disappointed at being left behind,
but he had told Mornice they would want to see her at
the office by five o’clock. To which she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be there at four, then, and you can do me a tea
beforehand. By-oh, Ron,” as they rattled over the cobbles
of the station yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Eliphalet, “we have a choice between Mrs.
Devon and Mrs. Montmorency. Which shall it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice voted in favour of “The West Countrie” as
being less high-sounding than Montmorency. Accordingly
they addressed themselves to Mrs. Devon’s knocker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! but the good lady’s rooms were already engaged.
Yes, she had heard of Mrs. Montmorency, but could claim
no actual acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she hazarded, “she’s been abroad a good deal.
But there! it doesn’t do to say anything, and there isn’t
any reason to suppose she won’t make you comfortable—but
still! That’s the house at the corner—Number Six.
The one with the funny blinds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they crossed the road and attacked the bell of Number
Six, and after a decent pause the door was opened by a
middle-aged woman with an apron but no cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet addressed her as “Madam” and enquired if
she were Mrs. Montmorency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” came the reply, with a touch of pride, so Mornice
thought. “No, but I do for her. I’m Emma. What might
you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are requiring two bedrooms and a sitting-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-es. We could do that. Are you theatricals? But
there! I needn’t ask, for it’s stamped on your faces as
plain as the words on a wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet remarked that the doorstep was inhospitable,
and suggested they might be invited to inspect the rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall see them,” said Emma, adding, “Such as they
are.” She led them within. “There—this’d be the sitting-room,
if you was to take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is, in any case,” said Mornice with a twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma shook her head discouragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come!” said Eliphalet. “This is quite comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the twin of every other theatrical parlour, with its
ponderous wallpaper, plush upholsterings and curtains, palm
pedestal in the window and draper’s paintings on the walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma nodded gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it’s all right,” she allowed. “If you want to
see the bedrooms, you’ll ’ave to climb the stairs, for there’s
no other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the procession to the floor above, and revealed
two reasonably well-kept bedrooms, with blue linoleum on
the floors and scarlet Paisley eiderdowns on the beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think this should suit us very well. Er—what about
terms, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma straightened a little doormat with the dilapidated
toe of her shoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ardly know what to say about terms. You see, she’s
funny about ’em. Tries to get all she can—but she always
takes less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I could speak to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, you couldn’t, not very well. Y’see, she’s out—Saturday!—You
know what I mean. You must arrange
with me or not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, as you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about twenty-five shillings, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet hesitated, on principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should probably be here for three weeks,” he
observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re not playing in the town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; rehearsing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a pity, ’cause I’d ’ave asked for a seat Friday.
’Sides, if you’re r’hearsing, it’s unlikely you’d be able to
afford twenty-five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could afford a great deal more,” said Eliphalet,
with a touch of silly pride. “But one does not pay more
than a penny for a penny bun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But even then you may get a stale one,” replied Emma
philosophically. “Well, I should think twenty-five shillings
’ud be enough, then. ’Tis enough, as a matter of fac’—plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well; we will leave it at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I ’spec’ she’ll raise a rare to-do about it, but
one can’t help that. Pity she wasn’t ’ome ’erself—but there,
it’s Saturday, and you know what that means! ’Ave you
’ad your dinners?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mornice; “and we’re dreadfully hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose a chop each ’ud do, for liver’s very dear,
and I don’t suppose you want to spend much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A chop will be excellent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll leave you to wash your ’ands. There are some
bits of yellow in the soap-dishes, but if you’ve brought your
own, I’d use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the stairs she turned and addressed Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may as well be warned. The ’andle of the water-jug
in your room is only stuck on with fish-glue, so you’d
better lift by the sides when you’re pouring out. Three
people ’ave paid for that ’andle already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks awfully,” said Mornie, trying not to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought I’d tell you. Not but what you’re sure to
forget; then you’ll make the fourth.” And with this melancholy
foreboding Emma descended toward the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma’s cooking of the chops was of more attractive
quality than her conversational manner of introducing them.
She further supplemented the meal with a sweet omelette,
expressing a doubt, while serving it, that the price of the
eggs used would probably “put them in a state” when they
had to settle the bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice was enchanted with Emma, and gave a graphic
performance of her voice and manner for Eliphalet’s after-dinner
delectation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s lovely,” declared Mornice; “and I only hope Mrs.
‘Montblancmangy’ will be half as funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady in question did not arrive home until after
Mornice had set out to meet Ronald Knight. It was about
five-thirty when Eliphalet heard the click of a key in the
front door and the sound of footsteps in the passage. Apparently,
the owner of the house was a clumsy person, for a
great rattling betokened a collision with the umbrella-stand.
There followed the noise of objects falling, and Eliphalet
undertook to surmise that the three plush-backed clothes-brushes
had been flung from their brass hooks to the floor.
A certain amount of scuffling ensued, and then a female
voice, speaking in detached tones, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dash the things! Let ’em lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting on this resolution, the footsteps continued their
way down the passage, and a door at the far end banged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” said Eliphalet Cardomay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma came from the kitchen and entered her mistress’s
parlour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Montmorency was seated in a wicker chair, and her
head moved from side to side in a rhythmic measure. On
the floor beside her lay various belongings—a bag, an umbrella
and a pair of gloves. Upon her lap was a large
brown-paper parcel, suggestive of the wine merchant, and
this she grasped securely by a small leather handle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a largely-built woman on the wrong side of fifty,
and the clothes she wore would have befitted better a less
advanced age. Large plaques of jewellery shone from her
expansive bosom and implicated themselves in the lace and
trimmings of her blouse. Across her shoulders was a fur
cape, which, in conversational periods, she styled as “My
mink.” An elaborate hat, at the moment somewhat awry,
reposed upon her butter-coloured hair—hair dressed <span class='it'>à la
pompadour</span>. Her face was a fine shade of purple, the intensity
of which had been somewhat toned down by a liberal
application of powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve let the rooms,” remarked Emma. “Theatricals—an
old chap and ’is daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decidedly!” replied Mrs. Montmorency, her head still
moving and increasing the raffish angle of her hat. “Decidedly!
I should think so, indeed! Why, good gracious
me, yes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you know all about it, there’s no call for me to tell
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None whatever—decidedly not! What did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re—you’re Saturday!” said Emma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Montmorency stiffened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any sauciness, and out you go—bag and baggage, lock,
stock and barrel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t part with the barrel—not if you thought
there was anything in it,” returned Emma, with asperity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, Emma, you forget who you’re speaking to. Now,
what did you say about the rooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let ’em, that’s all. Twenty-one shillings a week for the
two upstair fronts and the sitting, and they’ll stay three
weeks like as not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This comes of my going out!” declared Mrs. Montmorency.
“It means that I can’t go out, and that’s what
it <span class='it'>does</span> mean! Who, may I ask, please, have you let my
rooms to at such a price?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old fellow and his daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daughter, indeed! Decidedly, I should say so. A nice
thing altogether. Well! it’s what I expected—no more, no
less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tell ’em to go if you’re not satisfied—I ’aven’t
sheeted the beds yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s at my pleasure, and one more piece of sauciness
and you’ll be the one to go. But I’ll charge them for the
cruet—ninepence a week, and any breakages will be double—double.
And now, please, what are the names of the
precious pair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you wouldn’t—decidedly not. You’d turn my house
into a warren for all the rag-bag and nameless vagabonds
in the town. I’ll see them myself, and you can be sure I’ll
have my say, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I should take off my ’at and straighten up a bit
first—for you look for all the world like a needle in a
hay-stack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma walked from the room and slammed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Montmorency rose from her chair and, approaching
the mirror on the mantelshelf, Narcissus-fashion surveyed
her own loveliness therein. Seemingly she found Emma’s
counsel good, for she removed her hat and cast it upon a
chair, where it was crushed in the emotional crisis that
followed. Her hair she pawed and patted into some pretensions
to order—her face she enriched with a fresh crust
of powder. From a scent-spray, convenient to hand, she
directed a jet of some heliotrope-coloured fluid upon her
bosom. This done, she straightened her figure and passed
out into the passage, with primmed lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To avoid the impression that by letting a room she sacrificed
the privilege of entering it at will, she turned the
handle of Eliphalet’s door, without knocking, and walked
inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that the old actor had closed his eyes for a
few moments and was sleeping—his back toward her. Mrs.
Montmorency sniffed, but, failing to awaken him, circumnavigated
the table until his features, lit up by the cast-down
glare of the incandescent gas, confronted her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she looked and then, with a curious
throttled cry, turned about and fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet sprang to his feet and arrived in the passage
in time to see the door at the far end swing to with a bang
that shook the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How very curious!” he said, and returned to his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! It’s Cardy,” gasped Mrs. Montmorency, panting
breathlessly against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rang the bell furiously, but when Emma arrived
waved her away with, “No—no—I want nothing. I’ve
had a shock, that’s all; but I can manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She managed uncommonly well, and it must be considered
as providential that her purchases that afternoon had included
two bottles of brandy whereby the ill effects of the
shock were capable of being warded off. By the time the
first bottle was at half-tide, she was able to review the
situation less fearfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was her first husband—the man who divorced her—living
under the same roof as a guest, and with him was a
grown-up daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would be the result of this intolerable coincidence?
As a late member of the Boards herself, her imagination
supplied many startling solutions. The conventional idea
was that Eliphalet, realising what he had thrown away,
would implore her to take pity and return to the shelter
of his arms; the dramatic, that after years of anger and
dull hatred, the sight of her would cast him into such a
frenzy that murder would be done. In support of this
theory came the memory of how once he had called out his
man to fight with pistols for the sake of her honour. It
was all very irritating and tiresome, coming as it did at the
time when she had settled down to peaceable ways of living.
As fruits of many affectionate years, she was left with money
enough to buy the small lodging-house, and a matter of
fifty pounds per annum over and above to guarantee a convivial
Saturday at the end of each week. This was not
affluence by any means, but it sufficed to make life endurable.
It was impossible that Eliphalet would be in so good
a position, and was it not more than likely that if he discovered
her, his first thoughts would be to negotiate a loan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This latter theory caused Mrs. Montmorency more uneasiness
than any other. Generosity was not a strong point,
beyond the latitude she allowed herself for personal indulgences.
Clearly, then, Eliphalet Cardomay’s propinquity
was not to be encouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more she rang the bell for Emma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What terms did you ask these people for my rooms?”
she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked ’em twenty-five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they beat you down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Emma, who was sick of the whole affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought as much. And where are they playing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nowhere. They’re r’hearsing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! And who ever heard of letting rooms to an
actor who was rehearsing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got to sleep somewhere while they’re doing it—haven’t
they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not going to sleep here—not after to-night,
or to-morrow at the latest. That I <span class='it'>have</span> made up my mind
to. This house is not a charitable institution; whatever else
it may be, it isn’t that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A truer word never passed your lips,” said Emma, and
escaped before the inevitable warning about sauciness found
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Montmorency drank soberly for an hour to lubricate
her reflections. She heard Mornice come in about eight
o’clock, and was fired with a desire to go into the passage
and denounce her. This project, however, she abandoned
for want of material for the accusation. She decided that
a dignified letter would be the best means of being rid of
the pair of them, and this she set about to write. But,
chiefly due to the error of dipping the wrong end of the
pen into the ink, the dignity failed to appear on the page.
Even in her semi-bemused condition she realised that Eliphalet
could hardly be expected to fathom the meaning of
her shadow-graphs, and so decided to leave the matter
unsettled until the morning. That being so, it was obviously
a slight on her maker of cognac to leave the bottle unemptied—and,
after all, it was Saturday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was singing some little trifle of song when, about ten
o’clock, she perilously mounted the stairs toward the oblivion
of her bed-chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the arrival of the day Mrs. Montmorency was able
to approach the problem with a clearer headache. She
recollected, with a start, that only a few inches of brick and
plaster separated her from her one-time husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma did not offer her breakfast on Sunday mornings,
for to do so was to incur a rebuke for sauciness—and so,
when dressed, nothing prevented Mrs. Montmorency from
getting to work at once upon the eviction of her tenants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long while she sat with the pen in her mouth and
her brows contracted in thought. To tell the truth, she
was not gifted with a high standard of literary attainment.
As a girl, she could dash off as many as you please of the
“My own darling boy” sort of letters which ended with “tons
of love and kisses,” but this severer kind of exchange presented
abundant difficulties. With the exception of Eliphalet,
none of her husbands, or those who had passed as such, was
of a scholarly turn. Harrington May, Mornice’s father, on
whose account Eliphalet had divorced her, though by no
means a fool, had not troubled to obtrude his erudition upon
her. Similarly, none of the other hands through which she
had passed had used their skill to mould her intellect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, however, she contrived a letter which gave her
every sort of satisfaction. It ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—<span class='it'>My Emma in my absence let you rooms at terms
unsatisfactory to myself. Mrs. Montmorency is a lady who
does not take in lodgers without good credenshalls. This is
not to in any way say that your credenshalls may not be all
right, but as I have no knowledge of you she feels the let
is not satisfactorily. It would be necessary under such a
state as yours for payment to be made for the whole time of
three weeks in advance. As it is not likely under your
present state you could do this or be able she feels obliged
to ask you to go elsewhere without trying to be impolite.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:9em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='it'>I beg to remain</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:7em;'><span class='it'>Yours faithfully,</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Mrs. B. Montmorency</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice had brought Ronald in to lunch, and this letter
was handed to Eliphalet simultaneously with the apple-tart.
He frowned a little as he read it, and remarking “Extraordinary
woman!” handed it to Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s sweet!” cried Mornice. “Read it, Pyjams.”
Then to Emma, “Do ask her to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma had been schooled in what to say should this
request be made. Her manner of putting it was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s in bed. Bit funny to-day! You know what I
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will reply later,” said Eliphalet. When Emma had
left the room, he picked up the thread of the former
conversation—his familiar views upon the degradation of
acting for the Cinema.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, sir,” said Ronald, who had listened very politely,
“I am sure Miss Mornice June would have a great future
in the film. My father agrees with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no future for the film, my boy,” corrected
Eliphalet. “Now, for the stage——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight agreed heartily that the art of the stage
ranked on a far higher plane, and expressed his own very
proper ambitions in this direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, Eliphalet was pleased with the young man,
and lost his sense of jealousy when Mornice “Ronnied”
and “Spuddied” him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had gone and Eliphalet had replied for about
the nineteenth time, “Certainly he is a very agreeable young
fellow,” he turned to the matter of the letter again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very curious,” he said, after reading it a second
time, “but there is something familiar about the composition
and handwriting of this note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you say so, it strikes me too,” said Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “Then I am sure it is merely imagination
on my part. But that is unimportant. This is very offensive,
and I am seriously disposed to ask for the bill and go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice dissuaded him. Emma made her laugh, she
said, and her bed was a dream without lumps. Probably
the poor thing was hard up, and it was just a try on to get
money in advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if that is so, and you are satisfied, there is no
reason why she should not have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly he sat down and wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Madame</span>,—<span class='it'>I am in receipt of your letter and hasten to
applaud the spirit of caution that inspired it.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>It has not been my habit to give credentials when taking
rooms, since I believed my name to be a sufficient guarantee
of probity. However, since this appears to be a condition
you require, I enclose five pounds, three guineas being for
rent and the remainder towards current expenses.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Awaiting your acknowledgment and receipt</span>,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:7em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='it'>Yours faithfully</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'><span class='sc'>Eliphalet Cardomay</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>(with a flourish beneath).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, is he going? Was he wild?” demanded Mrs.
Montmorency when Emma brought the note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither, by the looks of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear! Give me the letter, then, and don’t stand
there looking as if—if——” She could think of nothing,
so opened the envelope instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of the five-pound note gave her astonishment
and perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it like him!” she exclaimed, when she had read
what he had to say. “Prosy old fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” inquired Emma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not addressing you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit one of her short, podgy fingers, and thought hard.
“Wish I could see him for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you’ve let all the front room windows, like the
fool you are. That’s the worst of a house without a
basement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and see ’im in his room—’e’s there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t, and I don’t want any saucy suggestions from
you, either.” She tapped her foot and fingered the five-pound
note indecisively. “You’ve been in the provinces all
the while I’ve been abroad. Have you ever heard of
Eliphalet Cardomay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course. Who ’asn’t? Runs his own companies,
doesn’t ’e? I suppose anyone who’s heard of Queen Anne
’as ’eard of ’im.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His own companies? What sort of theatres?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big drama houses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh! That’s the worst of being out of the swim
so long. H’m! Wonder if it ’ud be a mistake——” She
took a pen and wrote a receipt for five pounds. “With
Mrs. Montmorency’s compliments, please, and tell him she
is satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma placed it on the arm of Eliphalet’s chair, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right! You don’t ’ave to go, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay’s five-pound note had created a profound
impression on Mrs. Montmorency. That he, at his
age, could produce so large a sum without protest or difficulty
argued that he must be in a singularly sound financial
position. A man who could do so much could probably do
more—and if that were the case——</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had worked out her life on strictly practical lines—the
margin for enjoyment being limited by her tangible
assets. It was purely motives of economy that only allowed
the indulgence of a single “Saturday” in the week. With
a little more capital a “Saturday” might also occur on
Tuesday. Her “mink” might cease to be a substitute and
become mink. Scented soaps, patchouli, and many other
nose-offending delicacies might spring into being about her.
A cellar, even, might be started, and a silver mirror added
to her gradually-dwindling toilet appointments. Clearly, it
was not advisable to cast Eliphalet forth without first
plumbing his resources. That grown-up daughter was rather
a stumbling-block. Daughters are unsympathetic creatures,
and it might very well be that she would stand in the way
of her father’s generous impulses. The main thing to do
was to find out exactly what their position was, and meanwhile
to lie low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three days Mrs. Montmorency digested her plans and
took great pains to avoid meeting her guests. This necessity
resulted in some very near shaves; in one case driving
her to take refuge in the cistern-cupboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma was valueless, since she declined to interrogate
either Eliphalet or Mornice on the matter of their private
affairs, and it was only by accident that Mrs. Montmorency
learnt that Mr. Ronald Knight, who visited the house
nearly every day, was the gentleman who had recommended
them to her tender graces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a happy windfall, for it provided an excuse for
offering him her thanks and at the same time drawing from
him a little private conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following afternoon, which was too wet and dark to
be of use to the film folk, Mr. Knight returned with Mornice
and entered the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner did Mrs. Montmorency hear his voice in the
sitting-room than she opened the front door and passed
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a broad-minded pastry-cook’s at the corner of
the street, where cherry-brandy and sweet wines were dispensed
to nervous ladies, and, using this as an observation-post,
Mrs. Montmorency sat down to a pleasant hour of
waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cardomay out?” said Ronald, warming his hands
before the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yup. They’re doing the second act—he won’t be in till
five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald bore the tidings with fortitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to be awfully good in that film, Morny,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure so! If it gets released and well booked they’ll be
after you like flies—all the big firms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bon!” said Mornice, who could throw a spice of French
into her conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose dozens of men have adored you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. We’ll take a tram to-morrow, if you please,
and look at their little graves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever loved any of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any <span class='it'>one</span> more than the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but not so’s you’d notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t be very original of me, then, to say I loved
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be if you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scarcely knew how to take that, but he tried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you want me to be original?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can’t be natural,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were natural,” said Ronald, with a deep breath, “I
should ask you to marry me—when I’ve got on and have a
good position. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come, Ronnie,” said Mornice, who was used to
protestations of love but a stranger to proposals of marriage;
“it’s a sporting offer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you take it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her pretty little mouth into all manner of tantalising
and absurd shapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d like to have it by me to think about and enjoy
all by my lonesome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want me to go away? I will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norrabit! You stop. I’ll let you know some day. The
matter shall have our serious consideration,” she added, and
laughed provokingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and stood beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morny, it’s awfully difficult to stop without wanting
to—to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To kiss you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mornice, “and what’s to prevent you,
please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might not like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m certain I should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pouted up into his face, and he kissed her, and she
kissed him—and very proper, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a deal too much nonsense talked about kissing;
it should be encouraged, for all that bacteriologists say to
the contrary. Reliable young people, with properly ordered
minds, ought to kiss each other far more frequently than
they do. It is a delightful, frank and wholesome pastime—and
does any amount of good all round. Of course, if you
are a prude and attach an absurd significance to a kiss,
there is no more to be said, and it is your own look-out and
your own loss. But if you take it as a seal of good fellowship,
and expression of the youthfulness that sings in every
decent heart, however old, it is right and good and proper.
Besides, no one will mind, that way. They will slap you
on the back and say you are a jolly good fellow, and she’s
a dear, sweet, natural girl, and your wife will kiss your own
particular pal’s husband, and she will snuggle none the less
close to you on that account, nor will you press his hand
with any the less warmth. If we abandoned kissing the
people we don’t want to kiss, and only gave our caresses to
the ones we do, the world would be an ever so much jollier
little globe to live upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald was in a very glorified frame of mind when he
came down the road, and, seeing him, Mrs. Montmorency
rose from her fourth cherry-brandy and debouched from
the confectioner’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr.
Knight,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said; “but forgive me if I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Mrs. Montmorency. You were kind enough to
recommend me to my present guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes! So I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was so kind of you, and I wish to say how grateful
I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not at all—delighted! Good afternoon!” For Ronald
was very happy with his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am stepping your way, Mr. Knight, and if you don’t
mind, we’ll walk together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could he do but acquiesce?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is rather a delicate thing to say,” she went on, “but—well,
I’m rather particular, and I’ve been abroad for a
good many years.” (She branched aside to give a few impressions
of the Antipodes.) “So, you see, I’ve rather lost
touch. What I do want to know is, are the Cardomays
quite nice people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald supported them hotly and enthusiastically. He
represented Eliphalet as a delightful personality who, professionally,
was second only to Sir Henry Irving in the
hearts of the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was encouraging, but Mrs. Montmorency had not
gained all the information she required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the dear young lady—such a sweet girl, I think—she’s
entirely dependent on the old gentleman, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” returned Ronald. “She’s playing lead in
an important film production at a very substantial salary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How nice! Nothing I like better than to hear of young
people getting on. I’m an old pro. myself, Mr. Knight;
used to be quite a star in my day. But, dear me! I’ve
passed my turning. Thank you so much, and good afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon,” repeated Ronald, delighted to be rid
of the lady of haunting odours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That settles it,” said Mrs. Montmorency to herself.
“It wouldn’t be fair to me if I didn’t take the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast next day Eliphalet found a note on his
plate stating that Mrs. Montmorency would be highly honoured
if he would favour her with a call in her private
boudoir at six that evening. He sent a reply to the effect
that he would be pleased to come at the time stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mrs. Montmorency was rehearsing the reconciliation
scene from every possible mental angle. She decided
to adopt the attitude of a tired woman, sick of the
world and its frivolities—a woman who yearned for tenderness
and the warmth of a home fire. Contrition there
should be in plenty—a hint of many privations, bravely
borne, and a show of still amply-filled wells of affection
wherefrom a man might fill his bucket with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ransacked her wardrobe and produced a peignoir constituting
a cross between a kimono and a Nottingham lace
curtain. This garment, she felt sure, would lay siege to
any heart. With her own hands she ironed and prepared it,
then laid it aside upon the bed until the hour for dressing
should arrive. Naturally, these exertions called for stimulant,
and a bottle of brandy was broached with beneficial
results. From a hidden recess she unearthed an early portrait
of Eliphalet, and this she placed in a frame, occupied
by some more recent tenant of her affections, and hung it
on the wall in her boudoir. Emma was despatched, not
without protest, to procure half-a-dozen arum lilies and half
an ounce of cachous. The lilies were bestowed in vases on
the mantelshelf, and the cachous fought a losing fight with
the brandy-fumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All being in readiness, she mounted the stairs, abandoned
her corsets, donned the peignoir, and made what little improvements
to her face were expedient with creams and
powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t imagine what she wants with me,” said Eliphalet,
“but” he glanced at his watch—“I soon shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing Mornice a smile, he went down the passage toward
the private boudoir. There was no answer to his
knock, so he turned the handle and walked inside. Mrs.
Montmorency hung over the bannisters above, and watched
him enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding himself alone, his first thought was to retire, but
an innate curiosity caused him to look about him first. The
lilies attracted his attention, or rather diverted it from
the garish vulgarity of the other decorations. His eye
was caught by the photographs on the walls, for he recognised
several old faces among them. All theatrical lodgings
are plastered with portraits of the various actors who
have distinguished them with their presence, but there was
something in the sequence of the portraits that seemed oddly
familiar. Somewhere, on some past wall, he had seen the
same picture gallery assembled. Where? He turned and
found himself face to face with his own portrait—his portrait
as a very young man; written across it in ink, autumnal-brown
with time, were the words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my dear Blanche—Eliphalet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then said a voice behind him, speaking in trembling
accents:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been so miserable, Cardy. All these years I have
never known a moment’s peace and quietude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He revolved slowly and confronted the woman who had
been his wife. Her hands outstretched toward him. He
did not move, but looked her over gravely. Dolled up,
painted, and smelling of half-a-dozen cheap perfumes that
strove in vain to subordinate the reek of still stronger waters—she
was all that his fancy pictured she would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it’s you, Blanche,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, me—what’s left.” (He nodded at that.) “If you
knew, Cardy, what I have gone through—what my conscience
has suffered for the way I served you, you would
take pity. That’s why——” She made a gesture as though
to say, “Behold the wreckage”—“And you—you so young-looking,
so handsome, and with a beautiful grown-up daughter!
Oh, Cardy, it’s too much to bear. You must forgive
me and take me back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sobbing piteously, she fell into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet let her sob for as long as he could hold his
breath; then he placed her in a chair and seated himself
as far away as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need you envy me so acutely?” he said. “You married
again, and bore a daughter after you ceased to be my wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” she nodded, dabbing her nose, which sprang
to a bright purple at the touch; “but it’s cruel to remind
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” His voice was courteous, but unsympathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She—Oh, and she was such a pretty, dainty little thing.
I can’t speak of her, Cardy. I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a choking voice she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was taken—taken——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean she died?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Died; yes. Only fourteen—getting on so nicely, too;
beginning to earn her own keep, like the one you’ve got.
But there, you’ve always been the lucky one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God,” he said, “I think I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an awkward remark to counter, so Blanche kept
up her pathetic wail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be like the touch of my own child, just to see
your daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall,” said he, and walked to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This movement was ahead of its cue, so she hastened to
exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not now—wait till I’m myself again. Cardy,
can you—will you let me come into your life again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can discuss that later, I wish to show you my daughter
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went straight to his sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornice,” he said. “Our landlady—she—she’s your
mother. I want you to come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice gasped, but made no articulate reply. Hand in
hand, they entered Mrs. Montmorency’s boudoir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occupied a full five seconds before Mrs. Montmorency
grasped the situation; when she did, she sat bolt upright
and exclaimed, “O God!” in the most colloquial way imaginable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice said nothing, which in the circumstances was the
best thing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Eliphalet, “is there anything to be gained by
continuing the scene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Montmorency rose and gave herself away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you were earning a good living, weren’t you?” she
demanded of Mornice. “My—er—friend didn’t like children,
and I had my own way to make. Then when I met
Mr. Montmorency abroad, and told him about you, he
couldn’t be bothered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I quite understand,” said Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls should be made to look after themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet cut in with “I think all that is necessary has
been said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche breathed desperately through her nose. She had
lost ground, and saw no hope of regaining it. As a last
cast—a final appeal to the emotions, she volunteered to
faint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going off!” she cried. “Quick—brandy!” Her faltering
gestures indicated the cellarette very concisely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet poured a measure into a convenient glass, and
she gulped at it greedily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the faint—an unconvincing affair of eyelid work
and hand-twitching—took place. From a kind of innate
chivalry they waited until such a time as she thought fit
to recover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will say good-bye, Blanche,” said Eliphalet. “Your
daughter and I have our packing to do. Is there anything
else you wish to say to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there isn’t,” came the uncompromising reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ll say this to you, though,” said Blanche. “You
are a pig—that’s what you are—an old pig!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out, closing the door as her similes climbed
the ladder of abuse in a ringing crescendo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, as they drove through the cool night air, toward
the hotel, Eliphalet thoughtfully said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right, my dear; it wouldn’t have been any
good. But it’s a pity for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she answered, laying her warm little hand in his.
“I’ve got a Daddy fatherums, haven’t I?”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CLOUDS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Night Cry” was a failure—and a melancholy
failure at that. Why this should have been is hard
to understand, since, as a play, it compared favourably
with many successful productions in Eliphalet Cardomay’s
repertoire. Perhaps the truth was that Eliphalet was getting
old. The most skilful tricks of lighting and make-up failed
to conceal this obvious fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ought to retire,” said the wise playgoers, as they
passed sorrowfully from the theatre. “A fine old chap,
but he’s stopping too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing in the world destroys confidence more
quickly than this kind of talk, and nothing is more easily
destroyed than an actor’s reputation. People repeat such
phrases for want of something better to say, and slowly but
surely it comes back to ears that are ever attentive for a
hint of the kind—attentive because their owner’s pockets
are affected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the last five seasons Eliphalet’s receipts had shown
a gradual, almost imperceptible decline, but it was not
until the production of “The Night Cry” that the fall was
considerable. And it was considerable! The vibrations
set in motion thereby automatically were felt afar and
closed the purses of the four commercial gentlemen who
formed his syndicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet was distressed at the want of success, but philosophical.
He reflected with gratification that it had not
been his wish to do the play. He had asked for support for
a production of “Hamlet,” and had been denied; thus, not
unreasonably, he conjectured this might prove a lesson to
his syndicate for the future to respect his judgments. Besides
which, a certain percentage of failures was inevitable,
and in all his career that percentage had been very low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every Christmas he and the syndicate met to discuss the
past year’s work and make future plans, and this was
always the occasion for a little ceremony. Eliphalet brought
with him four boxes of Half Coronas, and one of these he
solemnly presented to each member of the board. They,
although offering no tangible return, would express a surprised
gratification and a vote of cordial appreciation for
his artistic energies exerted on their behalf. A luncheon-party
would follow, which broke up with handshakes and
good and seasonable wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on this particular year Eliphalet felt, no sooner he
had entered the room, that there was a strange atmosphere.
Each of the four gentlemen showed embarrassment and disinclination
to meet his eye. The cigars were presented and
accepted, which appeared to heighten the general unease.
Then the chairman rose and called upon Dr. Wardluke to
address the meeting, as his own powers of speech were affected
by a recent cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the doctor, after some rustling of papers and a deal
of pulling at his waistcoat, came to his feet and spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, he said, a great pleasure to them all to observe
that Mr. Cardomay had been spared to attend another of
these pleasant annual meetings, and he was sure that none
of them contemplated the fact that this was to be the last
without sensations of regret. Their association had been
more than pleasant—it had been cordial; but sooner or later
the best of things came to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cardomay has been a loyal colleague to us, Gentlemen,
and I venture to say we have been as loyal to him.
But what was it that Æsop said about the bow?” No
one appeared to know. “Well, I can’t recall the exact words,
but they go to prove that you must not strain anything
beyond its limit. It makes us very happy to reflect that,
mainly through our support, Mr. Cardomay must now be in
a comfortable financial position, and it will be pleasant to
think of him spending his autumn years in some quiet little
nook, standing back from the road.” He resumed his seat
to an encouraging salvo of “Hear, hear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eliphalet Cardomay rose, and he looked a little
white and drawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take it,” he said, “by all this preamble, you wish me
well, and for that I express my thanks. I was not aware
you intended to break up our partnership, and perhaps it
would have been more business-like and kinder to have informed
me beforehand. However, that may pass. Doubtless,
from your point of view, Gentlemen, I am an old pair
of shoes to be thrown aside as outworn, but I would remind
you that this”—and he pointed with his stick to a play-bill
of “The Night Cry” hanging on a wall—“this is the first
time they have let in the water. I accept my dismissal,
Gentlemen, without demur, but reserve to myself the right
to choose the hour of my retirement to that ivy-clad nook
Dr. Wardluke painted with such eloquent impertinence in
his speech. I would further recommend you to keep an
eye on the theatrical columns of your newspapers, where you
may see that these old shoes are still capable of covering a
good many miles of the road. Good day, Gentlemen, and
good-bye.” He swung his hat to his head like a cavalier,
and walked proudly from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He booked a ticket to New Brighton, where, at the conclusion
of her first film engagement, Mornice had joined
him. It had always lived in Eliphalet’s brain that when he
retired it would be to dwell within sight of the sea in that
most delightful of resorts. The circumstances of staying
there at the hour of his dismissal struck him as coldly prophetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we haven’t finished yet,” he said, as the train bore
him westward. “We’ll show ’em there’s stuff in the Old
Card still!” No actor properly realises he has outstayed his
welcome until his backers forsake him, and even Eliphalet
was not convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was enthusiasm in his voice and fire in his eye. But
the train had not travelled many miles before the enthusiasm
died and a queer gnawing doubt assailed him. Was it
possible, after all, these gentlemen were right? Would it
not, perhaps, be better to slip away from the haste and turmoil
of active life and seek out that little villa of his own?
After all, he had fought nobly and successfully, and surely
the right to repose had been well earned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was standing to his credit at the bank enough, and
more than enough, to assure a comfortable competence to
the end of his days. Perhaps, too, he was a little tired.
He had run without stopping for so many, many years.
Then he thought of his boasts to the syndicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll challenge ’em, old boy, and we must make good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was Mornice, too, to be considered. He had promised
her a big chance, and it was up to him to meet the
bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight had come over to spend the day with
Mornice (a not infrequent occurrence), and they rose, apparently
from the same chair, as he entered the room. Maybe
they were a shade embarrassed, for neither one nor the
other asked how the meeting had gone, but, instead, gave
themselves over to expressions of almost unnatural delight
at his return. Consequently, tea passed without the subject
being mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glancing from one to the other, Eliphalet was conscious
of an air of supreme excitement shared between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he asked, “has the Mornice film been—what is
the word?—released yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no, not yet. Matter of fact, we’ve had rather bad
luck—very bad. No one seems to care for the story.” Eliphalet
smiled rather cynically, and the young man hastened
to add: “But Morny has made an enormous success. Terrific!
We had a private projection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A private show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes! Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With big-wigs from the best firms, and they are absolutely
unanimous that she’s <span class='it'>it</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice tried not to look too proud, but the artifice
was transparent. Eliphalet frowned a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad,” he said. “She is certainly very capable—of
better things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I know you hate movies,” said Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald started afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A success like that, even at a private proj-show, means
a great deal, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” Eliphalet cut in, “you are now going to tell me
she has had some flattering offers and ask me to let her
accept them, knowing very well that the last time I allowed
her to do so was on the undertaking that she returned
to the legitimate at the end of the engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald’s reply was unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I—what she—what I’m sure we all
feel she ought to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to, awfully,” exclaimed Mornice; “in something—— Oh,
you go on, Ronny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only that people—people in the show believe there
is such big stuff in her that makes me suggest it.” He hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet leaned back in his chair and smiled indulgently
to help him along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all know she is a young Modjeska—a little Bernhardt—eh,
Mornice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be saucy, Dads. After all, he’s only repeating
what they think. I don’t know whether I am
great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Very few actors and actresses are absolutely certain on
this point, but most of them have a comfortable conviction,
even though they may not express it.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had seen little heads swell large too often to
be surprised. He nodded to Ronald Knight to proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody who saw her in that film believed she’d
make a fortune on the legitimate stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The potential gold-mine, and certainly her mass of hair
was in itself a large enough nugget, was licking jam from
a sticky finger like a child at a school-treat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Ron,” she said. “Go on now about the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus adjured, Ronald drew breath for fresh adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you remember, sir, a few years ago buying a play?-‘A
Man’s Way’ it was called. You never put it on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember—yes. A fine, vigorous piece of work. I
made some alterations to the text. But somehow it wasn’t
satisfactory. But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was written by a cousin of mine. I happened to mention
your name, and he showed it to me. By Jove, it’s
magnificent! Now, as it was in the original form, that play,
with Morny as the wife——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come! A very, very difficult part, my dear boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t seen her on the film.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m! Well, I must look it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s here,” said Mornice. “I rummaged it out of your
basket.” She produced the MS. from beneath a sofa cushion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet turned over a few pages, stopping here and
there. A startling modernity still seemed to spring from
every line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no doubt of its worth,” he mused; “but so very
modern!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but, Dads, isn’t that just what it should be? And
it is such a wonderful part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if it would suit me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wife’s, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe,” said Ronald, “people are getting tired of
old-fashioned plays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Eliphalet. “I wonder if that is
why——” He stopped, frowned, and struck the table a
blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Dads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone wants to alter the tide of my life to-day.”
He rose and started to pace excitedly up and down the
room. “Why is it? You want me to break new ground,
plough fresh pastures; and they, they say I am done with—finished!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My syndicate. They spoke of a rustic cottage, standing
back from the road, in which to spend the autumn of my
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dared they! What did you answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told them to read the theatrical news—that was all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo!” applauded Ronald, with great sincerity, adding:
“Then, by Jove! if you did this play, starring yourself
and Morny, wouldn’t it be a terrific smack in the eye for
them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am nearly seventy,” replied Eliphalet, “and I suppose
it is wrong and foolish at such an age, but I would like
to show ’em something, I would!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you?” said Ronald and Mornice, in one voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, some three days later, Eliphalet sought Freddie
Manning, wisest and most energetic of stage-managers, and
told him what had happened and what he intended to do,
Freddie spoke up boldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you, Guv’nor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall, Manning. It’s a final cast, and I mean to go out
with a flourish. We shall advertise it as a farewell tour.
New scenery—posters—everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who’s backing you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie cast his eyes above, but held his peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall star Mornice in equivalent type to my own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you,” repeated Manning. “If she’s a wash-out,
the come-back will be twice as strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take the risk. I am going to produce ‘A Man’s Way’
in the original form, and in every respect to rival a West-End
production. I shall have wooden doors, and the
scenery will be three-ply instead of canvas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose you’ll have a West-End cast as well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had thought of it,” he confessed, “but I cannot go back
on the Old Crowd. There will be only one newcomer besides
Mornice, and that will be Mr. Ronald Knight. For
the rest, the Old Cardomay Company will see Old Cardomay
out. As regards booking, I shall accept the best No. 1
towns only, and shall book a three months’ tour; not at
the drama houses, but at the principal theatres in every
case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Manning tilted his bowler hat to the extreme limit
of possible angles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guv’nor,” he said, “God alone remembers how long
we’ve been together. I was a super-boy in the crowd when
you were playing juveniles; and boy, man and veteran, we’ve
fought side by side in nearly every shack with footlights
from Land’s End to John o’—what’s-’is-name. You’ve stuck
by me fine, and I’ll stick by you to the end and past it.
I’ve never openly countered a scheme of yours, though I
may have pulled a few strings on the quiet; but this time
I do, and as man to man, I put it down that you cut it
out—right out. If the advice ain’t wanted, say so and I’ll
buckle on to the new job for all I’m worth; but those are
my feelings, Guv’nor, and I had to speak ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Manning, I quite understand. Likely enough
you are right, and this is a great folly. But I want to do
it—I want to make one final splash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough,” said Freddie. “I’ll get busy straight
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Freddie Manning got busy, busy he undoubtedly
was. Eliphalet told him to go ahead with the scene folk,
the costumers, the advertising experts, and two thousand
pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a general rule, ladies and gentlemen provide their own
modern clothes for provincial tours, but in this case, in the
matter of ladies, Eliphalet departed from precedent and
undertook the responsibility of providing them. To the
gentlemen he addressed the following words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want this production to be memorable, and to that end
everyone who appears in it must appear under circumstances
most agreeable to the eye. In our profession it
is not always possible to maintain one’s wardrobe at a
state of perfection, and we are over-liable, perhaps, to run
our suitings beyond the limits of appearance and durability.
To encourage you all, then, to do justice to me and the
play, I propose to pay an additional twenty-five per cent on
your ordinary salaries. One more word, Gentlemen, and I
have done. We are all tradesmen, with the trade at our
finger-tips. Let us show that we, of the provincial theatres,
can give, in appearance, intelligence and art, as good (if
not better) measure as our brothers in the capital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the rehearsal began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first reading Eliphalet was delighted. The play
seemed to act itself. He experienced an odd sensation that
there was little or nothing for the producer to do—that it
rested with the company to commit to memory their lines
and repeat them from appropriate positions upon the stage.
He had not realised that the true human modern play is
almost automatic, and that its crises arise from the general
team-work of the company, and not by individual effects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it goes so well while they are holding their books,
what will it be when I have shaped it up?” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of these agreeable reflections he failed to
observe a very obvious change had taken place in Mornice.
Since persuading him to do this play and place her among
the stars, she underwent a complete metamorphosis of manner.
She adopted the worst characteristics of a leading
lady. She gave the company good-morning each day with
an air of great condescension. She trespassed into that forbidden
Tom Tiddler’s Ground near the centre of the footlights
reserved for producers and the managerial branch.
She devoted less attention to her part than to criticisms of
other people’s renderings. She would follow members of
the company to dark parts of the stage and give advices
that were neither desired nor of the smallest value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You who read these pages, do not be too severe in your
judgments upon her. In a scarcely-formed mind certain
mental conditions inevitably result from success or prominence
upon the stage too soon. A name seen by its owner
for the first time on the hoardings in three-inch block type
acts as an intoxicant. Mercifully, the condition is transitory,
and you will find that your really successful actor or
actress is, as a rule, the jolliest and least sidey of individuals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her idea, supported by Ronald Knight, that the
women’s costumes should come from Redfern’s—it was she
who had seen the magic three-ply scenery at Wyndham’s,
that does not vibrate when Mr. du Maurier goes forth and
closes the door crisply behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To do the young people justice, they never for an instant
thought they were doing otherwise than serving Eliphalet
an excellent turn by their exuberant suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a darling, Ronnie,” Mornice would say, most days;
“but he is old-fashioned, and if we are to make the play go,
we must modernise him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But window-boxes on the pyramids will not make them
resemble art villas at Letchworth, and this fact they learnt
too late to be of use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, these many preoccupations kept Mornice so
busy that the study of her part was almost entirely side-tracked,
but it never occurred to her to entertain misgivings
on that account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time a slight staleness was discernible in the
progress of the play. Eliphalet could not tell whence it
arose or how to combat it, but vaguely he wished for the
services of some virile brain other than his own to preside
at rehearsals. Mr. Raymond Wakefield, for instance, who
had tied him up in such painful knots on the occasion of
his appearance in London. He would have known in an
instant what was required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were legions of tiny but vital subtleties that cried
out for definition, and in all Eliphalet’s bag of tricks there
was no machinery for bringing them into focus. In every
scene they bubbled up through the lines, like vortices in
quicksand. A thousand fine points of psychology that
needed assembling, refining and giving prominence. Eliphalet
was bewildered by their numbers; he did not know
where or how to start work upon them, and he sat by the
footlights, brows contracted, finger-tips together, in silent
dissatisfaction with himself and the play. On the seventh
day of rehearsals he rose distractedly, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not getting on, ladies and gentlemen. I am
sure we are all doing our best, but we are not getting any
forrader.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then old Kitterson spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, Guv’nor; but it’s devilish hard. How are we
going to get big effects out of these lines? I’m not saying
anything against ’em, mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so natural, Guv’nor,” complained Mellish, another
old-timer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Fullar shook her head wisely. “That’s it; too natural.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not for big effects we must try,” said Eliphalet,
“but for the little ones. The big effects in this play arise
from the little. Therefore we must try to create a standard
excellence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, perhaps, the nearest approach toward expressing
the essentials of a modern production he ever made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but how are we to do it?” old Kitterson questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we shall see,” said Eliphalet, rather feebly, and subsided
into his chair again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At supper that night he was rather dejected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheer up, Dads,” said Mornice. “After all, you and I
have most of the work to do, and we shall make things go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her rather seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see what to do with you,” he said, “for you are
far astray from the part. It is the others who perplex me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice was taken back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I am not up to the mark yet,” she replied, “but
I’ll let myself go to-morrow.” Then, quite satisfied that
her own case was established, she turned to vital matters.
“Pummy! you’ll have to get your hair cut, you know. You
can’t possibly play a smart doctor, and keep it long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have realised it, my child.” He looked at her with
a queer smile, and said, “Are you Delilah, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be regretted that Mornice had little knowledge
of the Old Testament. She asked for particulars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady who cut off Samson’s hair. Shorn of his locks,
his power departed.” Then his mind came from east to
west with a vengeance. “I am glad I took you from the
Cinema before it was too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m. You are cinema-acting very alarmingly in ‘A Man’s
Way.’ Coding, my dear, coding; I will show you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morrow he was ready for her in earnest, and realising
this, Mornice flung herself into the part with startling
energy. He did not allow her to go far before holding
up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” he said, “try to remember you are playing the
part of a married woman who is at variance with her elderly
husband. Do not therefore swing an imaginary sun-bonnet,
or smile and blink your eyes at the audience, as though
each one was a potential lover. You have three acts in
which to gain their affections—not thirty feet of film.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are horrid,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. Believe me, this—this bright stuff is entirely
misplaced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she came on again, and this time resembled a woman
torn by conscience after rifling a church of its plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now you go to the opposite extreme—you will have
no emotions left for the big moment in the last act, if the
opening of a door causes you so much distress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the ordeal was over, Mornice was a trifle piqued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think he ought to have gone for me like that
before the company, Ron—do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ronald Knight was an honest lad, and answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, there was sound stuff in what he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A reply which put him in prompt disfavour for a period
of twenty-six hours, at the end of which time they met, by
a kind of mutual magnetism, and kissed each other with
enthusiasm in the dressing-room corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sorry for what you said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry it offended you, but I think it is up to us to
do what the old chap wants. After all, he’s taking a big
risk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight was beginning to feel some uneasiness
about the wheels he had set in motion. Having some knowledge
of what a well-put-on production costs, he wondered if
Eliphalet’s resources were up to the strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To do them justice, the company worked like Trojans. It
is true, some of their energies were misplaced, but they were
all well-intentioned. Miss Fullar, for instance, as the duchess,
gave the impression that the duke had married far beneath
his social station. This impression was partially obliterated
when the duke himself appeared in the second act,
and gave place to doubts as to how the lady could ever have
accepted his addresses. Mellish played a man-about-town,
but had the misfortune to choose the wrong town, and never
once came within the four-mile radius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Kitterson’s butler was sound—he had specialised in
this line for many years—but the part caused him great
disappointment, since there was nothing to do or say that
was not strictly in the way of domestic service. Not once
in any act did he have the opportunity to exclaim, “God!
it’s Master Harry!” followed by a stumble forward, a hand-grip
and a sobbing “Sir—sir!” He asked Eliphalet whether
this popular effect could not have been introduced into the
text, but Eliphalet turned a kindly but deaf ear to the
appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight was one of the bright features, and took
his place becomingly in the general scheme of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One regrets to record that Mornice June was neither
“great” nor “it.” She divided her rôle into small crumbs
of individual effect. It was as though she had installed a
mental switchboard, labelled with such tickets as Anger—Remorse—Sarcasm—Gaiety—Malice—(but
never aforethought).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay, although the part was wholly unsuited
to his personality, gave the best and most illuminating
performance of his whole career. It was totally unlike his
usual traditional method, and precisely like it should have
been. Quite naturally he seemed to know what to do and
how to do it with the least possible effort. It was a queer
caprice of fate that this simple method that he had viewed
with a kind of disrespectful sour-grapes awe should suddenly
have been made clear to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He played the part, so to speak, with his hands in his
pockets, and marvellous discoveries came his way. For instance,
he discovered that when a man is saying to his wife,
“You can go—you can get out,” he does not of necessity
take a position in the centre of the stage and throw a fine
gesture toward the door, but is more likely to scratch his
own ear or perform some other minor diversion. That this
mantle of naturalness should have descended upon him made
him all the more sensitive to the shortcomings of the cast.
It was cruel he should have learnt the value of simplicity too
late to be able to teach it to others; for that was the bitter
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would lie awake at night, thinking, and his thoughts
were far from peaceful. Supposing, after this supreme effort,
the play failed? It would mean the loss of everything
to him. His capital, his nerve, and his hopes for Mornice
would perish at a single blow. “Let it succeed,” he implored,
and the words were a prayer. “I want the little girl
to have her chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not healthy thoughts, and they snatched at him
all hours of the day and night. In the night especially they
would prod him into wakefulness. He would see pictures
of the grey, back-street under-world, where the unwanted
actors go. They danced before his eyes like green spots
with scarlet centres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strain told, after a while, and he came to rehearsals
haggard-eyed and irritable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing like irritability for getting the worst out
of a company—not so much because they resent it as because
it makes them nervy and distracts their thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day he had his hair cut he felt that his strength
had departed indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had arranged that there would be dress-rehearsals
for a week, that the company might become accustomed
to their clothes. The first of these depressed him as nothing
had ever done before. The women’s gowns had cost
nearly two hundred and fifty pounds, and, beautiful as they
were, they looked woefully out of place on the backs of the
Old Cardomay Company. Mellish, who had done his best
to achieve the outward appearance of a man-about-town,
cut a pathetic figure, despite the variety of his checks. He
gave the effect of being arrayed in his Sunday suit, and
wore a buttonhole of daffodils in the second act. Eliphalet
was conscious of something amiss with most of them, but
could not lay his finger on the point of offence. On the
whole, the extravagances of wardrobe seemed to cause their
wearers added uneasiness, and a more ungainly performance
he had never beheld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think, Manning?” he asked, tentatively,
when the curtain fell on the last act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” was the stony rejoinder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a lie,” said Eliphalet very softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Guv’nor; it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re all adrift—’cept you. They’ll drown you between
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet seized him savagely by the arm, and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have four days more, Manning. We can’t afford
to leave it like this. I shall get a producer from London—at
any price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rushed to the nearest Post Office and wired to Raymond
Wakefield, begging him to name his terms to attend
a rehearsal of ‘A Man’s Way.’ “If not for terms, then
come in pity,” he ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wakefield wired to say he would arrive next morning
by eleven-thirty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet called a full-dress rehearsal, with lights, for two
o’clock, and met Wakefield at the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even though several years had passed since their last
meeting, Eliphalet was struck with the same extraordinary
appearance of youthfulness borne by the eminent producer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come for love, Mr. Cardomay, and because your
wire breathed tragedy. What’s the sorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Second childhood,” said Eliphalet pathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Producing ‘A Man’s Way,’ aren’t you? Must say it surprised
me a bit. Plucky of you. Good play. Came to us
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; thought of putting it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s splendid news,” said Eliphalet, with a sudden revival
of confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s it shaped?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see,” said Eliphalet; then, with a wail in his
voice, “It has gone beyond my powers, Mr. Wakefield, and
I feel so old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all do before a new production,” came the cheerful
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want anyone to know who is in front,” Eliphalet
told Manning, “but tell the company I look to them to
do their utmost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the curtain rose and fell on the three acts of “A
Man’s Way,” and when all was over Raymond Wakefield
made his way round to Eliphalet’s dressing-room and walked
in, whistling cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” queried Eliphalet nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You old marvel,” said Raymond. “How d’you come
to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Act like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet flushed like a schoolboy praised for his bowling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all right, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You’re</span> all right. You’ve forgotten all you learnt in a
theatre, and are playing what you’ve learnt in life. If you
were twenty, or even ten, years younger——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m too old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course you are—and too old for this part. But it’s a
work. You’ll get no gratitude, though, on that account. I’ll
tell you what the public and the papers’ll say. They’ll say
you are not serving them with the goods they’re accustomed
to receive, and you’ll get slanged for default as sure
as there’s an agent in Charing Cross Road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond Wakefield’s mouth went down at the corners
like a child about to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t do! You’ve committed the unforgivable sin of
standing by your pals—oh, I know you have—and art and
philanthropy don’t mix and never will. My motto is to
sack everyone at the end of a run, and then look round
afresh. In consequence, I suppose I’m pretty well hated by
every actor on the London stage, and the best-beloved of
the public.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Miss Mornice June—the wife?” Eliphalet put the
question tentatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naughty, very naughty indeed. D’you know what I’d
do with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s my adopted daughter,” said Eliphalet, to be on
the safe side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d put her in the Cinema business, and live luxuriously
on a ten per cent. commission of the salary she earned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange you should say that. I gave her this part to
keep her away from the Cinema.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it wasn’t fair to the theatre public—or the Cinema
public either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you consider our chances of success are remote?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond dropped his cigarette to the floor, and twisted
it out with the heel of his boot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, He knows! It’s all a lottery. You’re of the
provinces—you should be able to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if I had to stake my last farthing in a theatrical
venture, it would not be in this one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Eliphalet. “Mine is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take no notice,” Raymond hastened to explain. “It
was only for something to say. Well, I must be going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you won’t stop a day or two and rehearse us a
little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I value the compliment, but I’m too conceited to reveal
my weakness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weakness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for I shouldn’t be able to help ’em. I’ll let you
into a secret. People imagine I can teach anyone to act.
I can’t. All I can do is to know who would be right in
certain parts. Then I engage ’em, and their combined elements
give forth a chemical compound known as a Brilliant
Production. That’s the whole secret. Tell that fellow—Mellish,
isn’t it?—not to wear daffodils in his buttonhole,
and to cut his moustache off if he can’t let it alone—and tell
the duchess to let her train take care of itself when she’s in
a drawing-room. God bless you, Mr. Cardomay, and good
luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands warmly, and hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old devil!” he muttered, as the stage-door swung
to behind him. One might have imagined that there was
an added moisture in his eyes if the idea were not so absurd.
A specialist has no feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a week later, Doctor Wardluke met Mr. Wilfred
Wilfur in the street, and the latter gentleman was in a
state of unparalleled excitement. In his hand he flourished
a copy of the <span class='it'>Bradford Mercury</span>, and he cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seen the news? Old Cardomay has come an almighty
cropper with that production of his—knew he would—knew
he would!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the two late members of the Cardomay Syndicate
congratulated themselves most cordially on the happy insight
that led them to “get out of it in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The papers were not kind—they were not even discerning.
As Raymond Wakefield foretold, they were mortally offended
with Eliphalet for departing from his usual routine
and cutting off his hair. Because they were accustomed to
see this actor in a “robuster class of work,” they totally
ignored the excellent quality of his acting. “There are
plenty of companies who can provide us with the modern
problem play, without Mr. Cardomay doing so. We look
to him to uphold the good old traditions of the drama, and
instead——” etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the cast were very properly chewed up, and
questions were put as to what reasons existed for advertising
a certain unknown and very amateurish young lady as a
star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The receipts for the first week were negligible, and the
second showed a substantial margin on the wrong side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have ten more bookings, and I must play them out,”
said Eliphalet desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are the fines in default of appearance?” suggested
Manning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet shook his head. “It wouldn’t be fair,” he
said. “There’s the company to consider. I promised them
three months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And d’you think there’s a single damned one of ’em
who’d hold you to that?” came the fierce rejoinder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us lose like gentlemen,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his savings dripped from him like the sweats of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was very silent at home those days, and week by week
went by without improvement. He would sit with his hands
listlessly down-hanging, and his eyes fixed in a vacant,
dreamy stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mornice did her best to brighten things up, but she did not
understand very well the workings of his mind. Her belief
in her own greatness, too, was slow to abate, and it was not
until a notice appeared in the <span class='it'>Manchester Guardian</span> (most
delightfully outspoken of organs) that illumination came,
and she realised her own contribution to the tragedy. They
gave the play one of its few good notices, but of her they
spoke with a frankness that allowed of no misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being by nature a good-hearted and dear little girl, she
put her arms about one of the red fire-pails on a dark landing
and wept with such pitiful vibrations that the water
spilled over and mingled with her tears. Here Ronald
Knight found her, and transposed her head to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone gets bad notices sooner or later,” he told her.
“But listen, Morny, here’s something to cheer you up. My
father has had an offer to produce for Raphaeli’s Film Company
in America, and he wants you to come out and play
<span class='it'>ingénues</span>, with a year’s guarantee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D-does he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I should be going too. It’s in ten days’ time
he’s sailing, just after we close here. There! You’re happy
now, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” she sobbed, kissing him to cheer herself up a
bit. “I’m miserable—about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” said Ronald. “Horribly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t have done it except for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget that I asked him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I made you, Ronny. What’s going to happen, supposing
he’s lost everything. D’you know, I’m beastly frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go and talk to him, Morny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went. He was sitting in his dressing-room, idly
twisting a fragment of paper that had shown the night’s
returns. He looked very old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he said, lifelessly, as they came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mornice broke out with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’re so frightfully sorry—we want to tell how
frightfully sorry we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stretched out a hand, and gathered hers into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear,” he said, “you mustn’t take a bad notice
to heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t that—I know now I ought never to have played
the part—but it was my beastly conceit that made you
do the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I ought to be kicked for pushing it forward,” said
Ronald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve watched you when you thought you were alone,
and seen how dreadfully sad and broken you looked, and I
know it’s because I’ve made you lose all your money—isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A something eloquently full of tragedy and sorrow in her
voice stung Eliphalet to a sudden need to lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “Whatever put such
a fancy into your silly little head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, dear, dear little girl, you are talking nonsense.
I have been sad, I confess it; but my sorrow was for you—I
feared you had suffered a great disappointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you mean that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll be all right after this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t worry about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do—horribly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disposed himself in a position of some importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornice,” he said, “I have figured now in nearly forty
productions, most of them successful. Think what that
means. Am I to be crippled by a single false move? The
idea is absurd. Where is your arithmetic, my dear? Ask
young Ronald here, and he’ll show you the sum on paper.
Maybe I shall have to cut things a trifle finer in consequence
of this, but what of that? No, no, no—my sorrow was all
for you, and since yours has ceased to be, why, then, our
sorrow is bankrupt, and we are all glad again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve shifted a weight from my mind,” said Ronald,
with an outward breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mornice hugged him ecstatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’T’any rate, I’m not going to be a drag on you any
more,” she said, and told the tale of the American offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Eliphalet, “I think you ought to accept. It’s
a selfish confession, my dear, and I want you to believe I
would have done my best for you, but I haven’t the energy
for much more work. Years tell, and I doubt if I could
stand the strain of another big venture. I mean to do myself
well—luxuriously—in that little cottage with the ivy-clad
porch that stands back from the road. You’d have
found it dull there, living with an old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have loved it—with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it. No, you’d be kicking the glass to
flinders in a week. I should try a young man instead of an
old ’un. I should try him.” He tilted his head toward
Ronald Knight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to God she would, sir,” said Ronald devoutly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind,” said Mornice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do,” said Eliphalet; “and I shall be left without
a care in the world, to enjoy an affluent old age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that, Dads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I do. But don’t go talking about it in the
company, or everyone will be trying to borrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went out, laughing, who had entered in tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manning,” said Eliphalet, when the stage-manager, according
to his custom, looked in for final instructions, “what
d’you think we could realise on the scenery and costumes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Bout four hundred. Laon’s should be good for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m! not bad. Tell ’em we’ll sell. Good night, Manning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“G’night, Guv’nor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned over the pages of his bank-book, and examined
the balance. “Ought just to see me through,” he muttered;
“and then—four hundred pounds!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>God sends happy thoughts when most they are needed,
and a vision arose of two young people laughing happily as
they passed from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We pulled off that scene, old boy,” he said. “Fairly
brought the house down.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FINAL CURTAIN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A keen eye would have failed to detect Eliphalet Cardomay’s
real feelings during the last week of his last
tour. Outwardly he presented the appearance of a man
at ease with his conscience and at peace with the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lucky public holiday added a couple of really good
houses to the week’s receipts, and the thirty sovereigns that
arose therefrom he presented to Mornice as a wedding gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With many thoughtful considerations he helped her purchase
a trousseau and fixed up details with Ronald’s father.
These two elderly gentlemen discussed marriage and contracts
with the cordial gravity such important matters demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire company was at the wedding, and very smart
indeed was the appearance they presented. Eliphalet had
given the ladies the Redfern gowns and added permission
for them to be worn at the church. He himself was most
spruce, a white gardenia in his buttonhole and his silk hat
(it had been treated with stout the night before to flatten
the nap) reflected the sunshine like a mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave away the bride with a nobility that kings might
have envied, and at the reception which followed, the little
speech he made was full of the happiest moments. He actually
allowed a waiter to pour him out a glass of champagne,
but although the glass was certainly emptied, there
was a strong rumour running that an aspidistra close at hand
received the wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wedding took place the day before the final performance,
and the happy pair departed in a shower of confetti
and a great draught from waved handkerchiefs, to
reappear on the two succeeding nights at the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to say good-bye to you and Ronald to-morrow
over a little dinner,” Eliphalet whispered to the bride. “It
will be easier than in the theatre. It is going to be rather
hard to lose you altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Ronald were sailing for America, and were going
straight to Liverpool after the curtain had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet made great and tender preparations for that
parting feast, and laid the table lovingly with his own hands.
Then at six o’clock he lit the fairy candles that twinkled
among the fruit and smilax, and waited. And Mornice arrived,
dressed in her prettiest trousseau frock—all by herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Ronald?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him to stop at home, Pummy. I sort of guessed
you want me by my lone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How many of these exquisitely-prepared little feasts are
left untasted? We are in love—or have to say farewell—and
we centre all our beforehand time setting out rare flowers,
fair dishes and delicate appointments, to show how very
greatly we care. And perhaps someone says, “How lovely
of you to do all this to me,” or maybe breaks a white rose
from its stem to keep in memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a hand stretches across the table, and another’s
takes it, and the little dishes are all neglected and the fairy
candles burn low. After the long, long silence and unspoken
words of love or parting, it all breaks up into a commonplace
putting on of coats, whistling of cabs, or catching of trains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arm-in-arm and hugging very close together, they walked
to the theatre, and as the illuminated face of the Town Hall
clock proved beyond question they were late, there was
nothing for it but to run the last hundred yards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Knight was at the stage-door and was cheered to
see them arrive breathless and laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eliphalet stooped and planted a hurried kiss on
Mornice’s cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, my boy,” he said almost fiercely to
Ronald, and passed through the swing-door toward his dressing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had meant to make a speech on the day he went out
of management, and the company, knowing this, grouped
themselves on the stage when the curtain fell on the last
act. Then, quite naturally, he knew it could not be done.
The things about which one really feels have so small a part
in speeches. So, when he found himself confronted by the
most sympathetic audience before which an actor ever appeared,
he learnt that all his art, technique and experience
availed nothing. Those dear, honest, familiar faces dimmed
as he looked toward them into a grey wet mist. Somewhere
in his throat a new pulse started to throb—and throbbed
burningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay shook his head like a child who is
lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I can’t,” he said. Then, with a feeble, impotent gesture
of farewell, he turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three cheers for him,” gasped Freddie Manning, his
face scarlet with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eliphalet Cardomay bolted from the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the performance he had managed to say a few
words, individually, to those old corner-stones of his dramatic
edifice who, for years and years, had worked the provincial
theatres under his managership. That had been
hard enough, God knows. Old Kitterson made no bones
about it, and frankly howled when Eliphalet gripped him by
the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely less reserved was Freddie Manning—the least
emotional of creatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m hating it, Guv’nor,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed all the ladies of the company and had a kind
word for each, but Mornice he steadfastly avoided, for there
was a limit to his powers of endurance, and he wished to
escape without any show of weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last person he spoke to was his dresser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t sleep at night, sir, for worrying about you and
your things. You won’t never be able to look after yourself
proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” said Eliphalet. “I shall miss you, of course,
but it will come easier after a while. You—you’ve been
more than attentive, Potter, and just a little parting
gift——” He pressed a five-pound note into the dresser’s
hand—a note that Potter secretly replaced in his master’s
pocket while helping him, for the last time, into the big fur
overcoat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay’s great farewell tour, with seventy-five
pounds a week spent on advertisement, was over and
done with, and out of the wreckage he salved four hundred
pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not raise a wail over the loss—he was too game;
but in his inner self was a tiny cry of disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had always cherished the belief that when he retired
it would be to go to the first real home he had ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The home, as he pictured it, was a little detached villa
at New Brighton. It would face the sea and there would
be tamarisk bushes, forming a guard of honour, from the
garden gate to the front door. He had worked out how
each room would look—just what furniture and pictures
there would be—as though it were a scene in a play. Every
detail was cut and dried and ordered in his mind. This
was to be his compensation for the sacrifice of his profession.
And now——!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four hundred pounds and his lonely self were all that
remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For about six weeks Eliphalet Cardomay drifted aimlessly.
He had nowhere to go and nothing to do. Late
hours having been the habit of his lifetime, it was impossible
to go early to bed, and the empty evenings hung like lead
upon his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter or two came from America, forwarded from his
old lodging, and these were the only bright spots on a desolate
landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday was a day that bothered him dreadfully. Every
Sunday for forty years he had been accustomed to the
rush of packing—of cabs—porters and long train-journeys.
To sit idle in his rooms and read the <span class='it'>Referee</span>, which in the
past had often seemed a very desirable thing to do, proved
in practice a very trying ordeal. He fretted all the morning
with a sense of important duties neglected, and usually
finished up by walking to the nearest railway station to
watch the theatrical trains pull out. Then he would return
and settle down, with a sigh, to an afternoon of irksome
inactivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never been a man with a wide circle of friends,
and the few acquaintances he met mostly took their pleasures
by leaning across the bar or hiving round the cheese at
a Bodega—a practice which he showed no disposition to
emulate. In consequence he was thrown entirely on his
own resources, and, as a result, there set in a kind of incipient
melancholy. He began to speculate how long four hundred
pounds would last, at an expenditure of thirty shillings
a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And three years of this sort of thing is about as much
as we could stand, old boy,” he said, when he looked at the
result of the calculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he continued to drift in a melancholy isolation, until
one day, upon a bench in Roundhay Park, he espied a
familiar figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a man—or, more truthfully, what was left of a
man—poor, shivering, down-and-out. But Eliphalet needed
no second glance to assure him that here was Sefton Bulmore—old
Sefton, who had done him a good turn—old
Sefton, squeezed from the boards to make room for younger
blood and fresher funniosities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sefton!” said Eliphalet, stretching out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pair of watery eyes were raised jerkily and scanned his
features. Then the old fellow came to his feet with astonishing
vigour. Lifting his right hand high in the air, he
brought it down whack into the extended palm, covering
it instantly with an embracing grasp from his left. It was
an old stage formula, executed with technical perfection.
(Try it yourself; you will find it is none too easy to do.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Old Card. By God, it’s the Old Card!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a world of enthusiasm in the tone—then suddenly
his manner changed to an extremity of confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is uncommonly fortunate. To tell you the truth,
old son, I’ve been a bit unlucky lately. But the Profession
sticks together, eh? For old sake’s sake—and if—if you
can’t lend me ten bob, five ’ud do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down—let’s talk,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they sat together on the park bench and talked, and
a hundred old stage memories and old stage personalities
were dug out from the unforgotten past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha! ha! fine fellows—fine fellows, all of ’em. ’Tisn’t
what it was in our young days. The Profession’s going to
the dogs, Cardomay, old son, going to the dogs fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fate’s been unkind to you?” queried Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unkind! Ha! I can remember turning up my nose
at forty pounds a week—and look at me now!” He pulled
out two empty trouser pockets and turned the palms of
his hands up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet considered for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bulmore,” he said, “I have a bit—not much, but a bit,
and, old man, I’m sick for someone to talk to. I worked out
that, taking things easy, I’ve enough to last about three
years—alone. Well, one-and-a-half in company would please
me better. Will you share?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, the Old Card’s a trump!” cried Bulmore, taking
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that years had fallen away from him in a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you know,” he went on, “I haven’t tasted solids for
a couple of days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tea is waiting at home now,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sefton Bulmore rose at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I hope that home isn’t far away, either,” he flashed,
with a touch of his old humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the tram-ride Bulmore’s spirits rose by leaps and
bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you what,” he exclaimed. “You and I together—tragedy
and comedy—we’ve the elements of a fortune between
us—a fortune, my boy. We’ll write a play—Cinema—pooh!—No
good to anyone! We’ll write such a play
as was never written before. And if we don’t knock
’em——! By God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light danced in Eliphalet’s eyes—the light of reviving
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an idea, Sefton,” he said. “An idea. Perhaps,
after all, we shall be wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bought watercress for tea, and cucumber, sardines
and potted meat, so it is no small wonder that the meal was
a success. Sefton Bulmore fairly expanded under its influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet arranged with his landlady for an extra bed to
be made up in his room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he said, “shall we fetch your things?—and
you can settle in comfortably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer Bulmore produced a pile of pawn-tickets and
laid them on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the lot,” he answered, “save what I stand up in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet went through the tickets to see what most essentially
should be redeemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d like your ulster, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been a good friend to me—still, two pound ten,
y’know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not another word,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they emerged from the pawn-shop Sefton Bulmore
was clad in a fur-collared coat which, despite a shade
of wear about the cuffs and elbows, was a garment any actor
might be proud to wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Eliphalet, “we’ll make for home and
have our first talk about the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a note of disappointment in Bulmore’s acquiescence,
that called for a querying eyebrow from Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only thinking—just to-night—old friends re-meeting—and—as
a little celebration——” He tilted his head
suggestively toward the brilliantly-lighted windows of the
Goat Hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never do,” said Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, I understand—but—to the success of the play—a
couple of glasses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go,” he said. “Here, take——” And he pressed
some silver into Bulmore’s palm, “I’d—I’d rather not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s sad work drinking alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have the pleasure of your company at home all
the sooner, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after eleven before Bulmore returned, and bed was
the obvious prescription. So Eliphalet helped him undress,
and listened to a good deal of maudlin matter, without
which the evening would have been a happier one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning they set to work mapping out a scheme for
their future. Being accustomed to work at night, they made
their plans accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They would breakfast late, partake of their one serious
meal at three o’clock, enjoy a cup of tea about half-past five,
and devote the evening hours to work upon the play. At
midnight the traditional Welsh rarebit, washed down with
a jug of good milky cocoa, would be served—then a pipe
and bed. To relieve any embarrassment in giving or receiving,
Eliphalet arranged that each should draw the same
weekly sum, and share alike in all things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the terms of partnership were laid down, and together
they set about to write such a play as would stagger
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plot was everything, they decided, and so to the making
of the plot were dedicated countless hours and an incredible
quantity of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the work proceeded Bulmore’s spirits grew apace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got ’em!” he would shout. “There’s a fortune
here, old man.” And so great would be his enthusiasm
that it was an all-too frequent occurrence for him to abandon
work in the early part of the evening and drink copious
draughts to their inevitable success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These little excesses were the cause of no small concern
to Eliphalet Cardomay. Bulmore would often spend his
entire weekly allowance in a night at the bar; thus, when
the day for settling their accounts arrived, it would be
necessary for Eliphalet to draw on his dwindling principal
to make good the deficit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the plot was finally determined, the actual writing
of the play began. In this Eliphalet did most of the work.
Bulmore’s temperament was such that he could not sit still,
and must needs pace up and down, gesticulating and pouring
forth a ceaseless stream of red-hot ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In itself this method proved a somewhat disturbing factor,
and tended to retard the progression of the work; but Eliphalet
strove manfully, and some eleven months from the
day of their first meeting had the exquisite pleasure of subscribing
the word “Curtain” on the final page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he and his partner gripped hands with a pride too
full for words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it aloud, Eliphalet, old man,” said Bulmore. “Let’s
have it! Let it go! Here, old man—wait a minute!” He
rushed from the room, returning a moment later with the
breathless landlady, Mrs. Wattle, and her anæmic niece,
Annie. These he literally flung (no other word is possible)
one at each end of the plush settee. “Don’t make a sound,”
he warned them, with a threatening gesture. “You are going
to hear the finest play that ever was written—a masterpiece!
On you go, Eliphalet, with all your voice, and all
you’ve got. Give ’em a bit of the old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Eliphalet filled his lungs, and read. Both he and his
audience were in tears when he intoned the final heart-rending
passages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he closed the book and laid his hand upon it—his
eyes filled with the light of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you think of it, Annie?” demanded Mrs. Wattle,
when she and her niece were restored to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be-utiful, be-utiful,” replied Annie. “It was just like
any drama you might see on the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no intended satire in this truest of criticisms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reading had proved altogether too much for Sefton
Bulmore, and being so elevated by the marvels of their
achievement, he went forth and indulged in a debauch, beside
which his previous excesses were as child’s play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet sat alone with the glory he had created. He
turned his eyes to the level of the gods, and prayed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be pleased to bless our work, O Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a cold tremor crept down his spine—brought to
existence by the sight of an unopened letter leaning against
the clock. He knew what it was—a statement of credit
from the bank—and had delayed breaking the seal, until
the play should be finished, lest, perhaps, the tidings should
divert his attention from the final scene. But now that
reason no longer existed. So he rose and tore open the
envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty-seven pounds was all that was left between two old
men and starvation. Almost miraculously the rest had
melted away. Fifty-seven pounds—and the Play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>AND</span> the play, old boy,” said Eliphalet. He tore the
sheet in two and dropped it in the fire; then, picking up the
manuscript, made his way to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he slept with a fortune beneath his pillow.
Of course the play had to be typed. They were too old at
the game to risk spoiling chances by sending it in MS. form.
The bill for the typing was four pounds—a big lump from
a capital of fifty-seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet had a long talk with Bulmore, and pointed out
the need for economy during the next few weeks, while managers
were considering their work. Bulmore was quite huffy
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems a sin not to have a good time, with a fortune like
this waiting to be picked up,” he grumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Eliphalet was firm, and for the first time a slight estrangement
arose between them. To mark his disapproval,
Bulmore went out and got drunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three copies of the play were duly registered and
posted to the three likeliest managers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sending the original manuscript to Mornice,” said
Eliphalet, “I would like her to see the part she might have
played, had she not given up the legitimate stage to play in
pictures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he packed it up, with a fatherly little note, and despatched
it to Mornice, c/o Raphaeli Film Company, at some
unpronounceable city in the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in a fever of excitement, they sat down and waited
for the herald of their fortunes to sound the trumpet of
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And quite suddenly Sefton Bulmore was taken ill. The
first-class doctor whom Eliphalet sent for at once, shook
his head over the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The machinery is worn out,” he said. “You can do
nothing, Mr. Cardomay, beyond care and attention. A
nurse may be necessary later on. Give him plenty of light
food—chickens, fish, and so forth, and above all keep him
cheerful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he say?” demanded Bulmore, when Eliphalet
returned after seeing the doctor out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you must take things easily for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! that’s all very well, but rehearsals will be starting
soon, and I’ve got to be there, y’know—I must be there.
Any news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at present. There’s hardly time yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fortnight. Ought to be hearing something soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And depend upon it, we shall,” soothed Eliphalet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was right, for the first copy was returned that
evening, with a curt note of refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet took it into the sitting-room and read it again
and again. It was unbelievable. Power, the likeliest of
all managers, had refused his play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t have read it,” thought Eliphalet. “Can’t possibly
have read it! I mustn’t let Sefton know this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he put the play in a fresh envelope and despatched it
elsewhere, and to salve his conscience for the deceit he
meant to perpetrate, he bought Bulmore some hothouse
grapes and a bottle of calf’s-foot jelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor old Bulmore was an indifferent patient—subject to
fits of depression and excitement. The sound of the postman’s
knock in the street brought him to his elbow at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down you go, down you go!” he would cry; then when
Eliphalet returned empty-handed, he would work himself
into a passion and curse the dilatoriness of managers or
accuse Eliphalet of having addressed the envelopes wrongly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, one day, about three weeks after his illness began,
two more copies of the play were returned. In one there
was no comment at all, and in the other a letter stating
that a market for such stereotyped work no longer existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh!” cried Eliphalet, with the tone of a wounded
child. “They don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was something that time,” exclaimed Bulmore,
as he slowly entered the room. “Quick—what was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lambert has written,” he said. “Wants to see me in
Bradford—to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old comedian’s body relaxed, and he gave a sigh of
wonderful relief. “Good God! To-morrow, eh? That will
be to discuss terms—yes. You’ll have to be firm—he’s slippery—’ll
want watching. Pity I’m like this. Pity—pity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed a mass of details that Eliphalet must be
sure to observe, and in the midst of them the doctor arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll want that nurse,” he said, as Eliphalet conducted
him downstairs. “He’s very rocky—practically living on
nervous energy. A bit intemperate in the past, I should say.
Well, well! I’ll send her in to-night. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” said Eliphalet, and turned into the sitting-room
to review the situation. At the present rate of expenditure
his finances could scarcely be relied upon to last
much longer. Yet what could he do? Bulmore must have
everything he wanted, of course, and the lie about the play
must be maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He re-addressed the two returned copies and posted them,
with a silent, fervent prayer. There were but six managers
in all to whom the play would be of possible use, and half
of these had already refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even chances, old boy; we mustn’t throw up the sponge
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he returned to minister to his partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have some champagne to-day—champagne, a sole,
and a dish of quails. We can afford ’em now,” croaked old
Bulmore. “No longer any need for economy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to maintain the lie Eliphalet bought all he asked for,
and more besides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the nurse came he told her of his deception, and
between them they kept the story going. Eliphalet invented
a wonderful interview with Lambert, in which he had asked
for and been accorded exceptional terms. Rehearsals would
be beginning in a very short while——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, by Jove, Sefton, we shall have such a cast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the poor fraud went on, and twice more the play
was returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost more than Eliphalet could endure, but he
kept a firm lower lip, and saw it through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About three o’clock one night the nurse awoke him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he’s going,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Sefton Bulmore was propped up in bed, and looked
a very sick man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laddie!” he gasped. “It’s up! Fate’s cheating me—you—you’ve
been a real friend—but I’m paying it all back.
Here—under my pillow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet drew from beneath the pillow a scrap of paper,
scrawled over with the words, “I bequeath all the interests
that will accrue to me from the play, ‘Right Triumphant,’
to my friend, colleague and benefactor, Eliphalet Cardomay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a fortune, o’ man—a fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet took the drooping hand from the coverlet and
grasped it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is beautiful of you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence; then Bulmore stirred slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make it a good funeral,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a final touch of irony, the last remaining copy of
“Right Triumphant” was returned a few moments before
Bulmore’s coffin was carried down the steps. And Eliphalet
Cardomay dropped it into the grave beside his dead comrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be profitless and painful to follow Eliphalet
through the job-seeking, grey underworld in which, during
the following months, he drifted. And while he drifted,
he lost heart and his pride began to forsake him. Eliphalet
Cardomay disappeared, and left no address. He lacked the
courage to confess his real state to Mornice. One deception
makes another easy, and about the time he had lied to
Bulmore about the play, he had written in answer to Mornice’s
constantly-expressed reproaches regarding his dilatoriness
in taking the little house, to say he had at last secured
the villa of his dreams. To make the story good, he described
the decorations of every room from attic to basement,
and even threw in a picture of the tamarisks in the
front garden. There had been a chance then that the play
would bring his words to truth, but that chance had gone,
and he could carry on the deception no longer. Thus with
his disappearance the sweet ties that had existed between
himself and his little adopted daughter were severed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow or another he managed to eke out an existence—but
it was existence, and nothing more. Only once did
he try to obtain work upon the stage, and the experience
was so humiliating he did not repeat it. Somehow he had
managed to preserve his old friends, the fur coat, the
broad-brimmed hat and the cane which had supported
him for so many years. He obtained an interview at a
Bedford Street Agency with a flaccid, swag-bellied Semite,
who wore a white waistcoat and check uppers to his glossy
boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never heard of it,” said this gentleman, when Eliphalet
roundly pronounced his full titles. “And there’s nothing
for your sort here. I’m looking over a bunch of supers
at five o’clock, and if you care to line up with them you can
take a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Eliphalet gravely, “but I think not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, for the Lord’s sake, get out. We’re busy here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eliphalet retired with dignity—as befitted one who
had held provincial audiences for nearly half a century, and
was part author of the finest play ever written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fate was a little kindlier after that, for he found employment
in a tiny Brixton paper shop, owned by a widow. She,
poor soul, was so occupied by her husband’s legacy, a girl
of three and two twin boys, that to attend to the shop was
an impossibility. So Eliphalet sat on a kitchen chair behind
the counter and dispensed halfpenny journals, bottles
of gum, penny note-books, and pencils with little tin covers
to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these surroundings he was moderately happy. There
were plenty of theatrical papers to read, for the neighbourhood
was patronised by the lesser geniuses of the dramatic
and music-hall world. In a way he became something of a
local character, and many an old “pro” would step in of a
morning to exchange reminiscences. Once or twice he was
recognised, but on these occasions he always begged his
discoverers not to disclose his identity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not that I am ashamed,” he said, “but there are
many I knew who, if they heard, would pity me—and
pity is a quality more blessed to bestow than to receive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So his wishes were respected, and for six tranquil months
the Old Card sold his papers and followed in the dramatic
columns the movements of members of his old companies.
Thus he learned that Freddie Manning had abandoned the
Road for the business managership of the Royal Theatre,
New Brighton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good boy, Manning,” he said. “That’s capital. New
Brighton, too!” Rather a twisted smile came to the corners
of his mouth, for he could not help thinking of that Dream
Villa, facing the sea. It would have been very pleasant
with Manning so close at hand, dropping in of an evening,
maybe, for a bit of late supper and a chat about old times.
Through the same medium he learnt how Mornice had
sprung to Fame as a Film Artiste and was commanding a
truly Chaplinesque salary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a matter that gave him less pleasure, for, although
rejoicing in her success, he could not conquer the
underlying conviction that the Cinema was the bastard
child of the stage, and an ignoble art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what she thought of my play,” he ruminated.
“I would like to have known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day there burst into the shop a little music-hall comedian
named Dwyer. He was one of the very few who
had recognised Eliphalet, and something of friendship had
sprung up between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seen this week’s <span class='it'>Foot-Lights</span>?” he demanded. Then,
without waiting for an answer, “They’re advertising for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He produced a crumpled periodical, flung it on the counter
and pointed to a certain passage with a nicotine-stained forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Eliphalet Cardomay will call upon or communicate
with Messrs, Newman &amp; Stranger, 108<span class='sc'>a</span>, Henrietta Street,
W. C., he will hear something greatly to his advantage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious!” said Eliphalet. “I wonder what that
means. I must step round there this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll step round now, old cock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hardly leave the shop——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That for a tale!” yelled the little comedian; then, making
a megaphone of his hands, he shouted, “Mother!” at the
very top of his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In response to the call the owner of the shop appeared, a
baby in her arms and the little girl towed along by her
skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s come into a fortune—see this! Mustn’t wait a
minute—You can spare him. Tell him to get his hat!
Shop’ll look after itself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Infected by the excitement of the moment, Mrs. Nelson
said he must go at once. Furthermore, she gave Eliphalet
the baby to hold, while she brushed his hat and coat and
polished the knob of his stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stand a cab,” said Dwyer, “for I won’t let you out
of my sight till I’ve heard the best.” With which, he half
swallowed two fingers of his right hand and produced a
whistle so piercing that a taxi seemed to spring from nowhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bread cast upon the waters returns after many days.
There was a certain quality in “Right Triumphant” which,
even though the stage desired it no longer, was still of an
order to find favour in the hearts of cinema audiences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manuscript copy of the play, sent to Mornice, was
read, at her request, by Mr. Raphaeli, who at once realised,
with her in the leading part, a film version might be played
with every hope of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Raphaeli was seldom wrong, and on this occasion he
was “righter” than usual. Eliphalet Cardomay had disappeared,
and enquiry failed to locate him, but to his credit,
on a ten per cent. royalty, a sum of three thousand pounds
had accumulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She looked after your interests pretty closely,” remarked
Mr. Stranger of Henrietta Street. “I think you may rely
on that sum doubling itself before the interest on the film
expires. By the way, here’s a bundle of letters from her
addressed to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay was wonderfully calm during the
interview, and did not betray by word or gesture the slightest
excitement, but his fingers trembled a trifle as he took
the letters. He received the address of a firm of solicitors,
who were looking after the money on his behalf, shook
hands, and walked from the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the pavement outside he conveyed the news to the
little comedian who, in his enthusiasm, performed a war-dance
which drew toward them a massive policeman, complete
with warnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t look half pleased enough,” he gasped,
when Eliphalet took his arm and drew him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am—I am—very pleased and very grateful. It’s just
a shade of disappointment that the play should not have
made its success on the legitimate stage.” But the cloud
faded almost before it came in the bright blue horizon of
the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A twinkle showed in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dwyer,” he said, “in all my life I have never yet borrowed
from a fellow-artist, but I am wondering now if you
would lend me a sovereign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever you want, old man; whatever you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simpson’s is just over there, and I was thinking—an
undercut from a saddle of mutton—you and I together-a
little celebration, what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine!” echoed Dwyer. “Take what you want out of
this——” producing a fiver from a Friday night envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned into Bedford Street there were a few old
down-and-outers of the profession, leaning disconsolately
against the wall of an agent’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet jerked his head toward them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind if I did?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better still!” shouted Dwyer enthusiastically. So Eliphalet
crossed the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys,” he said, addressing the group, “will you take a bit
of lunch with me? Just to talk over old times.”</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>Eliphalet Cardomay has the pleasantest villa in New
Brighton, with tamarisks forming a guard of honour to the
front door. The rooms inside are just what you would
expect—cosy, warm, hospitable. Sir Henry Irving’s signed
portrait, as Thomas à Becket, hangs over the fireplace in
the parlour, and there are many others of great-hearted, if
less celebrated, performers dotted about the walls in comforting
disorder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prominent in the centre of the mantelpiece is the portrait
of a baby, and scrawled across one corner in Mornice’s
go-as-you-please hand is written “Eliphalet to his grand-dads.”
Probably this photograph is his most cherished possession,
and he is justly proud that so bold a name should
rise afresh in a new generation. Mornice even on the occasion
when she and Ronald and the baby came over from the
States and spent a glorious three weeks at New Brighton,
never divulged the secret that this wonderful child was
ordinarily termed “-Potkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To minister to his wants are Potter, his one-time dresser,
and Potter’s wife—she was wardrobe-mistress in the company
for many a year. Between them they look to it that
the Old Card is kept out of draughts—has his socks scrupulously
darned—his sheets aired, and is served only with
the dishes he likes best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may see him any day you care to look, walking up
and down the parade with a firm step and his hat at a
fearless angle. Under his arm is the ivory-knobbed gold-mounted
cane of quaint design, and he shows a marked
favour for fur coats, of which he possesses more than one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is rare indeed for a Saturday to pass without Freddie
Manning looking in for an hour after the show. And
whether it be a supper of tripe, cooked in milk, a Welsh rarebit,
or a dish of sizzling liver-and-bacon, it all goes down
with equal appreciation, to an accompaniment of happy
reminiscences that mostly begin with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember that time in ’93—we put up ‘The Silver
King’ the following season——” And somewhere each evening
as regular as clockwork⁠——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say what you will, the stage isn’t what it was, Manning;
it isn’t what it was.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
